  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate on a large scale, across 272 common types of laboratory tests, the impact of healthcare processes on the predictive value of electronic health record (EHR) data. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: Two large hospitals in Boston, Massachusetts, with inpatient, emergency, and ambulatory care. PARTICIPANTS: All 669\,452 patients treated at the two hospitals over one year between 2005 and 2006. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The relative predictive accuracy of each laboratory test for three year survival, using the time of the day, day of the week, and ordering frequency of the test, compared to the value of the test result. RESULTS: The presence of a laboratory test order, regardless of any other information about the test result, has a significant association (P{$<$}0.001) with the odds of survival in 233 of 272 (86\%) tests. Data about the timing of when laboratory tests were ordered were more accurate than the test results in predicting survival in 118 of 174 tests (68\%). CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare processes must be addressed and accounted for in analysis of observational health data. Without careful consideration to context, EHR data are unsuitable for many research questions. However, if explicitly modeled, the same processes that make EHR data complex can be leveraged to gain insight into patients' state of health.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The histologic features of thrombus may differ according to the stroke subtypes. However, in acute reperfusion therapy, fibrin-specific thrombolytics are used based on the assumption that all thrombi are alike. AIMS: The histologic characteristics of thrombi were compared between patients with different stroke etiologies. METHODS: Between April 2010 and March 2012, we analyzed thrombi retrieved from acute stroke patients during mechanical thrombectomy. All thrombi were analyzed using component-specific stains such as Martius scarlet blue for fibrins and immunostaining with CD42b antibody for platelets. The stroke subtypes were determined based on the Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment classification. RESULTS: Among 36 patients, 22 were diagnosed with cardioembolism, 8 with atherothrombosis, and 6 with undetermined etiology. In arteriogenic thrombi, red blood cells were most abundant (56.9 {\textpm} 12.2\%), and the platelets covered the fibrin layers or were localized at the edge or periphery of the thrombus. In cardiogenic thrombi, fibrin was most abundant (39.5 {\textpm} 13.5\%), and platelets were clustered within the rich fibrin. Red blood cells proportion was greater in arteriogenic thrombi than in cardiogenic thrombi (p\,{$<$}\,0.001), whereas fibrin proportion was greater in cardiogenic thrombi than in arteriogenic thrombi (p = 0.003). Of six patients with undetermined etiology, the thrombi in five showed histologic features and composition similar to that of cardiogenic thrombi. CONCLUSIONS: Acute thrombi showed different histologic features according to the stroke etiology. The distribution of platelets and proportion of red blood cells and fibrin were major distinguishing factors between stroke subtypes.},

  abstract = {AIMS: Symptom-based pretest probability scores that estimate the likelihood of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) in stable chest pain have moderate accuracy. We sought to develop a machine learning (ML) model, utilizing clinical factors and the coronary artery calcium score (CACS), to predict the presence of obstructive CAD on coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). METHODS AND RESULTS: The study screened 35~281 participants enrolled in the CONFIRM registry, who underwent {$\geq$}64 detector row CCTA evaluation because of either suspected or previously established CAD. A boosted ensemble algorithm (XGBoost) was used, with data split into a training set (80\%) on which 10-fold cross-validation was done and a test set (20\%). Performance was assessed of the (1) ML model (using 25 clinical and demographic features), (2) ML + CACS, (3) CAD consortium clinical score, (4) CAD consortium clinical score + CACS, and (5) updated Diamond-Forrester (UDF) score. The study population comprised of 13~054 patients, of whom 2380 (18.2\%) had obstructive CAD ({$\geq$}50\% stenosis). Machine learning with CACS produced the best performance [area under the curve (AUC) of 0.881] compared with ML alone (AUC of 0.773), CAD consortium clinical score (AUC of 0.734), and with CACS (AUC of 0.866) and UDF (AUC of 0.682), P\,{$<$}\,0.05 for all comparisons. CACS, age, and gender were the highest ranking features. CONCLUSION: A ML model incorporating clinical features in addition to CACS can accurately estimate the pretest likelihood of obstructive CAD on CCTA. In clinical practice, the utilization of such an approach could improve risk stratification and help guide downstream management.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease treatment is still an open problem. The diversity of symptoms, the alterations in common pathophysiology, the existence of asymptomatic cases, the different types of sporadic and familial Alzheimer's and their relevance with other types of dementia and comorbidities, have already created a myth-fear against the leading disease of the 21st century. Many failed latest clinical trials and novel medications have revealed the early diagnosis as the most critical treatment solution, even though scientists tested the amyloid hypothesis and few related drugs. Unfortunately, latest studies have indicated that the disease begins at the very young ages thus making it difficult to determine the right time of proper treatment. By taking into consideration all these multivariate aspects and unreliable factors against an appropriate treatment, we focused our research on a non-classic statistical evaluation of the most known and accepted Alzheimer's biomarkers. Therefore, in this paper, the code and few experimental results of a computational Bayesian tool have being reported, dedicated to the correlation and assessment of several Alzheimer's biomarkers to export a probabilistic medical prognostic process. This new statistical software is executable in the Bayesian software Winbugs, based on the latest Alzheimer's classification and the formulation of the known relative probabilities of the various biomarkers, correlated with Alzheimer's progression, through a set of discrete distributions. A user-friendly web page has been implemented for the supporting of medical doctors and researchers, to upload Alzheimer's tests and receive statistics on the occurrence of Alzheimer's disease development or presence, due to abnormal testing in one or more biomarkers.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Rapid detection of abnormal biological values using point-of-care (POC) testing allows clinicians to promptly initiate therapy; however, there are concerns regarding the reliability of POC measurements. We investigated the agreement between the latest generation blood gas analyzer and central laboratory measurements of electrolytes, bicarbonate, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and glucose. METHODS: 314 paired samples were collected prospectively from 51 critically ill patients. All samples were drawn simultaneously in the morning from an arterial line. BD Vacutainer tubes were analyzed in the central laboratory using Beckman Coulter analyzers (AU 5800 and DxH 800). BD Preset 3 ml heparinized-syringes were analyzed immediately in the ICU using the POC Siemens RAPIDPoint 500 blood gas system. We used CLIA proficiency testing criteria to define acceptable analytical performance and interchangeability. RESULTS: Biases, limits of agreement ({\textpm}1.96 SD) and coefficients of correlation were respectively: 1.3 (-2.2 to 4.8 mmol/L, r = 0.936) for sodium; 0.2 (-0.2 to 0.6 mmol/L, r = 0.944) for potassium; -0.9 (-3.7 to 2 mmol/L, r = 0.967) for chloride; 0.8 (-1.9 to 3.4 mmol/L, r = 0.968) for bicarbonate; -11 (-30 to 9 mg/dL, r = 0.972) for glucose; -0.8 (-1.4 to -0.2 g/dL, r = 0.985) for hemoglobin; and -1.1 (-2.9 to 0.7\%, r = 0.981) for hematocrit. All differences were below CLIA cut-off values, except for hemoglobin. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to central Laboratory analyzers, the POC Siemens RAPIDPoint 500 blood gas system satisfied the CLIA criteria of interchangeability for all tested parameters, except for hemoglobin. These results are warranted for our own procedures and devices. Bearing these restrictions, we recommend clinicians to initiate an appropriate therapy based on POC testing without awaiting a control measurement.},

It is a consensus of the ISMRM Perfusion Study Group and the European ASL in Dementia consortium, both of whom met to reach this consensus in October 2012 in Amsterdam. Although ASL continues to undergo rapid technical development, we believe that current ASL methods are robust and ready to provide useful clinical information, and that a consensus statement on recommended implementations will help the clinical community to adopt a standardized approach. In this review, we describe the major considerations and trade-offs in implementing an ASL protocol and provide specific recommendations for a standard approach. Our conclusion is that as an optimal default implementation, we recommend pseudo-continuous labeling, background suppression, a segmented three-dimensional readout without vascular crushing gradients, and calculation and presentation of both label/control difference images and cerebral blood flow in absolute units using a simplified model.},

  abstract = {Chronic systemic sterile inflammation is implicated in the pathogenesis of cerebrovascular disease and white matter injury. Non-invasive blood markers for risk stratification and dissection of inflammatory molecular substrates in vivo are lacking. We sought to identify whether an interconnected network of inflammatory biomarkers centered on IL-18 and all previously associated with white matter lesions could detect overt and antecedent white matter changes in two populations at risk for cerebral small vessel disease. In a cohort of 167 older adults (mean age: 76, SD 7.1, 83 females) that completed a cognitive battery, physical examination, and blood draw in parallel with MR imaging including DTI, we measured cerebral white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and free water (FW). Concurrently, serum levels of a biologic network of inflammation molecules including MPO, GDF-15, RAGE, ST2, IL-18, and MCP-1 were measured. The ability of a log-transformed population mean-adjusted inflammatory composite score (ICS) to associate with MR variables was demonstrated in an age and total intracranial volume adjusted model. In this cohort, ICS was significantly associated with WMH ({$\beta$} = 0.222, p = 0.013), FW ({$\beta$} = 0.3, p = 0.01), and with the number of vascular risk factor diagnoses (r = 0.36, p{$<$}0.001). In a second cohort of 131 subjects presenting for the evaluation of acute neurologic deficits concerning for stroke, we used serum levels of 11 inflammatory biomarkers in an unbiased principal component analysis which identified a single factor significantly associated with WMH. This single factor was strongly correlated with the six component ICS identified in the first cohort and was associated with WMH in a generalized linear regression model adjusted for age and gender (p = 0.027) but not acute stroke. A network of inflammatory molecules driven by IL-18 is associated with overt and antecedent white matter injury resulting from cerebrovascular disease and may be a promising peripheral biomarker for vascular white matter injury.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: White matter hyperintensity (WMH) is an abnormal T2 signal in the deep and subcortical white matter visualized on MRI associated with hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, and aging. The Fazekas (Fz) scoring system is a commonly used qualitative tool to assess the severity of WMH. While studies have compared Fazekas scores to other scoring methods, the comparison of Fazekas scores and volume of WMH using current semiautomated volumetric techniques has not been studied. METHODS: We reviewed MRI studies acquired at our institution between 2015 and 2017. Relative WMH was scored by one author trained in Fazekas scoring. A board certified neuroradiologist scored them independently for confirmation. Manual segmentations of WMH were completed using 3D Slicer 4.9. A 3D model was formed to quantify WMH in milliliters (mL). ANOVA tests were performed to determine the association of Fazekas scores with corresponding WMH volumes. RESULTS: Among the 198 patients in our study, WMH were visualized in 163 (Fz1: n=66; Fz2: n=49; Fz3: n=48). WMH volumes significantly differed according to Fazekas score (F~=~141.1, p{$<$}0.001), with increasing WMHV associated with higher Fazekas scores: Fz1, range 0.1-8.3 mL (mean 3.7, SD 2.3); Fz2, range 6.0-17.7 mL (mean 10.8, SD 3.1); Fz3, range 14.2-77.2 mL (mean 35.2, SD 17.9); and Fz3 (excluding 11 outliers above 50 mL), 14.2-47.0 mL (mean 27.1, SD 8.9). CONCLUSION: Fazekas scores correspond with distinct ranges of WMH volume with relatively little overlap, but scores based on volumes are more efficacious. A modified Fazekas from 0-4 should be considered.},

The outcomes of interest were any type of CVD including acute coronary syndrome, coronary artery disease, stroke, or a composite of these cardiovascular events. Mean differences in NLR between CVD and non-CVD patients were pooled using unstandardized mean difference (USMD). Odds ratios of CVD between high and low NLR groups were pooled using a random effects model.               Results               . Thirty-eight studies (n=76,002) were included. High NLR was significantly associated with the risks of CAD, ACS, stroke, and composite cardiovascular events with pooled ORs of 1.62 (95\% CI: 1.38-1.91), 1.64 (95\% CI: 1.30, 2.05), 2.36 (95\% CI: 1.44, 2.89), and 3.86 (95\% CI: 1.73, 8.64), respectively. In addition, mean NLRs in CAD, ACS, and stroke patients were significantly higher than in control groups.               Conclusion               . High NLR was associated with CAD, ACS, stroke, and composite cardiovascular events. Therefore, NLR may be a useful CVD biomarker.},

Methods---                              We analyzed sex differences in outcome in consecutive patients with middle cerebral artery (MCA) M1 or M2 and internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion treated with intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT). Recanalization immediately after thrombolysis and outcome after 3 months were assessed.                                                          Results---                              Two hundred five patients (111 men) with MCA and 43 (22 men) with ICA occlusion were identified. Baseline variables did not differ between the sexes except for a higher prevalence of smokers among men in the MCA group (31\% vs 12\%;               P               =0.001). Partial or complete recanalization (TIMI flow 2 or 3) of the MCA was observed in 71 (75\%) women and 80 (72\%) men (               P               =0.488). In the ICA group, 14 (67\%) women and 11 men (50\%) showed TIMI 2 or 3 recanalization (               P               =0.425). Favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0 to 2) was seen in 57 women (61\%) and 63 men (57\%) with MCA occlusion (               P               =0.512) and in 6 women (28\%) and 4 men (18\%) with ICA occlusion (               P               =0.656). After multiple-regression analyses, there was still no association between sex and outcome (               P               =0.763 for MCA and               P               =0.813 for ICA occlusion) or recanalization (               P               =0.488 for MCA and               P               =0.104 for ICA occlusion).                                                          Conclusions---                              There was no association between sex and recanalization or outcome after IAT. These findings are in contrast to previous studies reporting better recanalization and outcome after IVT in women and might have implications in the selection of patients for IAT or IVT.},

  abstract = {Partial volume effects (PVE) are a consequence of limited spatial resolution in brain imaging. In arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI, the problem is exacerbated by the nonlinear dependency of the ASL signal on magnetization contributions from each tissue within an imaged voxel. We have developed an algorithm that corrects for PVE in ASL imaging. The algorithm is based on a model that represents the voxel intensity as a weighted sum of pure tissue contribution, where the weighting coefficients are the tissue's fractional volume in the voxel. Using this algorithm, we were able to estimate cerebral blood flow (CBF) for gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) independently. The average voxelwise ratio of GM to WM CBF was approximately 3.2, in good agreement with reports in the literature. As proof of concept, data from PVE-corrected method were compared with those from the conventional, PVE-uncorrected method. As hypothesized, the two yielded similar CBF values for voxels containing {$>$}95\% GM and differed in proportion with the voxels' heterogeneity. More importantly, the GM CBF assessed with the PVE-corrected method was independent of the voxels' heterogeneity, implying that estimation of flow was unaffected by PVE. An example of application of this algorithm in motor-activation data is also given.},

In this paper, we first present a detailed asymptotic analysis of model consistency of the Lasso in low-dimensional settings. For various decays of the regularization parameter, we compute asymptotic equivalents of the probability of correct model selection. For a specific rate decay, we show that the Lasso selects all the variables that should enter the model with probability tending to one exponentially fast, while it selects all other variables with strictly positive probability. We show that this property implies that if we run the Lasso for several bootstrapped replications of a given sample, then intersecting the supports of the Lasso bootstrap estimates leads to consistent model selection. This novel variable selection procedure, referred to as the Bolasso, is extended to high-dimensional settings by a provably consistent two-step procedure.},

  abstract = {Background: First-pass effect (FPE) is increasingly recognized as a predictor of good outcome in large vessel occlusion (LVO). This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to elucidate the factors influencing recanalization after mechanical thrombectomy (MT) with FPE in treating acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Methods: Main databases were searched for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies reporting influencing factors of MT with FPE in AIS. Recanalization was assessed by the modified thrombolysis in cerebral ischemia (mTICI) score. Both successful (mTICI 2b-3) and complete recanalization (mTICI 2c-3) were observed. Risk of bias was assessed through different scales according to study design. The I 2 statistic was used to evaluate the heterogeneity, while subgroup analysis, meta-regression, and sensitivity analysis were performed to investigate the source of heterogeneity. Visual measurement of funnel plots was used to evaluate publication bias. Results: A total of 17 studies and 6,186 patients were included. Among them, 2,068 patients achieved recanalization with FPE. The results of meta-analyses showed that age [mean deviation (MD):1.21,95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.26-2.16; p = 0.012], female gender [odds ratio (OR):1.12,95\% CI: 1.00-1.26; p = 0.046], diabetes mellitus (DM) (OR:1.17,95\% CI: 1.01-1.35; p = 0.032), occlusion of internal carotid artery (ICA) (OR:0.71,95\% CI: 0.52-0.97; p = 0.033), occlusion of M2 segment of middle cerebral artery (OR:1.36,95\% CI: 1.05-1.77; p = 0.019), duration of intervention (MD: -27.85, 95\% CI: -42.11-13.58; p {$<$} 0.001), time of onset to recanalization (MD: -34.63, 95\% CI: -58.45-10.81; p = 0.004), general anesthesia (OR: 0.63,95\% CI: 0.52-0.77; p {$<$} 0.001), and use of balloon guide catheter (BGC) (OR:1.60,95\% CI: 1.17-2.18; p = 0.003) were significantly associated with successful recanalization with FPE. At the same time, age, female gender, duration of intervention, general anesthesia, use of BGC, and occlusion of ICA were associated with complete reperfusion with FPE, but M2 occlusion and DM were not. Conclusion: Age, gender, occlusion site, anesthesia type, and use of BGC were influencing factors for both successful and complete recanalization after first-pass thrombectomy. Further studies with more comprehensive observations indexes are need in the future.},

Methods:             AIS patients receiving anterior circulation MT from our tertiary care academic institution were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. Additionally, a literature review and meta-analysis regarding the impact of sex on MT outcomes was performed. Favorable outcome (90-day mRS 0-2), mortality, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and symptomatic ICH (sICH) were compared.             Results:             1) From January 2019 to December 2021, a total of 347 AIS patients were recruited, including 126 females and 221 males. Before adjustment, females had a lower rate of favorable outcome (41.3\% vs. 52.9\%, P=0.037) and a higher rate of mortality (21.3\% vs. 11.3\%, P=0.867), but the difference was not significant after adjustment. ICH and sICH did not differ comparing females and males. 2) The systematic review and meta-analysis incorporated 8 eligible studies (3129 females and 3383 males), including our original data. A similar phenomenon was demonstrated; females were less likely to have a favorable outcome (OR 0.58, 95\%CI 0.45-0.75, I2=77.3\% ) and had a higher mortality (20.9\% vs. 17.1\%, OR 1.24, 95\%CI 1.06-1.44, I             2             =12.4) before adjustment, but there were comparable outcomes after pooling adjusted data (favorable outcome: aOR 0.85, 95\%CI 0.71-1.02, I             2             =63.8\%; mortality: aOR 0.85, 95\%CI 0.65-1.12, I             2             =33.6\%). There was no significant difference in ICH and sICH.             Conclusions:             Females showed a worse functional outcome after MT for AIS in a real-world setting, but sex innately is not a predictor of outcome after adjustment by confounding factors.},

  abstract = {In this work, we introduce an entirely data-driven and automated approach to reveal disease-associated biomarker and risk factor networks from heterogeneous and high-dimensional healthcare data. Our workflow is based on Bayesian networks, which are a popular tool for analyzing the interplay of biomarkers. Usually, data require extensive manual preprocessing and dimension reduction to allow for effective learning of Bayesian networks. For heterogeneous data, this preprocessing is hard to automatize and typically requires domain-specific prior knowledge. We here combine Bayesian network learning with hierarchical variable clustering in order to detect groups of similar features and learn interactions between them entirely automated. We present an optimization algorithm for the adaptive refinement of such group Bayesian networks to account for a specific target variable, like a disease. The combination of Bayesian networks, clustering, and refinement yields low-dimensional but disease-specific interaction networks. These networks provide easily interpretable, yet accurate models of biomarker interdependencies. We test our method extensively on simulated data, as well as on data from the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP-TREND), and demonstrate its effectiveness using non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and hypertension as examples. We show that the group network models outperform available biomarker scores, while at the same time, they provide an easily interpretable interaction network.},

It allows the investigation of biochemical characteristics of diseases, therapeutic effects and diagnostic and/or prognostic markers for disease with easy access and at relatively low cost. To this end, the Utrecht Patient Oriented Database (UPOD), an infrastructure of relational databases comprising data on patient characteristics, laboratory test results, medication orders, hospital discharge diagnoses and medical procedures for all patients treated at the University Medical Centre Utrecht since January 2004, was established. Current research within UPOD is focused on the innovative linkage of laboratory and medication data, which, for example, makes it possible to assess the quality of pharmacotherapy in clinical practice, to investigate interference between laboratory tests and drugs, to study the risk of adverse drug reactions, and to develop diagnostic and prognostic markers or algorithms for adverse drug reactions. Although recently established, we believe that UPOD broadens the opportunities for clinical pharmacoepidemiological research and can contribute to patient care from a laboratory perspective.

  abstract = {Background: In the last decades, the increasing number of adolescent and young adult (AYA) survivors of breast cancer (BC) has highlighted the cardiotoxic role of cancer therapies, making cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) among the most frequent, although rare, long-term sequalae. Leveraging innovative artificial intelligence (AI) tools and real-world data (RWD), we aimed to develop a causally interpretable model to identify young BC survivors at risk of developing CVDs. Methods: We designed and trained a Bayesian network (BN), an AI model, making use of expert knowledge and data from population-based (1036 patients) and clinical (339 patient) cohorts of female AYA (i.e., aged 18 to 39 years) 1-year survivors of BC, diagnosed in 2009--2019. The performance achieved by the BN model was validated against standard classification metrics, and two clinical applications were proposed. Results: The model showed a very good classification performance and a clear causal semantic. According to the predictions made by the model, focusing on the 25\% of AYA BC survivors at higher risk of developing CVDs, we could identify 81\% of the patients who would actually develop it. Moreover, a desktop-based app was implemented to calculate the individual patient's risk. Conclusions: In this study, we developed the first causal model for predicting the CVD risk in AYA survivors of BC, also proposing an innovative AI approach that could be useful for all researchers dealing with RWD. The model could be pivotal for clinicians who aim to plan personalized follow-up strategies for AYA BC survivors.},

SETTING: Decision-analytical model, comparing strategies of sequential tests for evaluating patients with possible stable angina in low, intermediate and high pretest probability of CAD, from the perspective of a developing nation's public healthcare system. PARTICIPANTS: Hypothetical cohort of patients with pretest probability of CAD between 20\% and 70\%. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome is cost per correct diagnosis of CAD. Proportion of false-positive or false-negative tests and number of unnecessary tests performed were also evaluated. RESULTS: Strategies using Ex-ECG as initial test were the least costly alternatives but generated more frequent false-positive initial tests and false-negative final diagnosis. Strategies based on CTA or ECHO as initial test were the most attractive and resulted in similar cost-effectiveness ratios (I\$ 286 and I\$ 305 per correct diagnosis, respectively). A strategy based on C-MRI was highly effective for diagnosing stable CAD, but its high cost resulted in unfavourable incremental cost-effectiveness (ICER) in moderate-risk and high-risk scenarios. Non-invasive strategies based on SPECT have been dominated. CONCLUSIONS: An anatomical diagnostic strategy based on CTA is a cost-effective option for CAD diagnosis. Functional strategies performed equally well when based on ECHO. C-MRI yielded acceptable ICER only at low pretest probability, and SPECT was not cost-effective in our analysis.},

We sought to provide cost-effectiveness information to aid physicians and decision-makers in selecting the most appropriate testing strategy. We used the state-transitions (Markov) model from the Brazilian public health system perspective with a lifetime horizon. Diagnostic strategies were based on exercise electrocardiography (Ex-ECG), stress echocardiography (ECHO), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), computed tomography coronary angiography (CTA), or stress cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (C-MRI) as the initial test. Systematic review provided input data for test accuracy and long-term prognosis. Cost data were derived from the Brazilian public health system. Diagnostic test strategy had a small but measurable impact in quality-adjusted life-years gained. Switching from Ex-ECG to CTA-based strategies improved outcomes at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 3100 international dollars per quality-adjusted life-year. ECHO-based strategies resulted in cost and effectiveness almost identical to CTA, and SPECT-based strategies were dominated because of their much higher cost. Strategies based on stress C-MRI were most effective, but the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio vs CTA was higher than the proposed willingness-to-pay threshold. Invasive strategies were dominant in the high pretest probability setting. Sensitivity analysis showed that results were sensitive to costs of CTA, ECHO, and C-MRI. Coronary CT is cost-effective for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease and should be included in the Brazilian public health system. Stress ECHO has a similar performance and is an acceptable alternative for most patients, but invasive strategies should be reserved for patients at high risk.},

To date, this has most notably been documented for lymphocytes and monocytes. In contrast, as neutrophils are traditionally considered, to be short-lived, terminally differentiated cells that do not re-circulate, the potential existence of distinct neutrophil subsets with functional and phenotypic heterogeneity has not been widely considered or explored. A growing body of evidence is now challenging this scenario, and there is significant evidence for the existence of different neutrophil subsets under both physiological and pathological conditions. This review will summarize the key findings that have triggered a renewed interest in neutrophil phenotypic changes, both in terms of functional implications and consequences within disease models. Special emphasis will be placed on the potential pro- and anti-inflammatory roles of neutrophil subsets, as indicated by the recent works in models of ischaemia--reperfusion injury, trauma, cancer and sepsis.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study 116 consecutive patients (77 males and 39 females) of stroke (within 72 hours of onset) were included. After clinical evaluation and neuroimaging, blood investigations, hemoglobin, total leukocyte count, platelet count, platelet aggregation, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), blood sugar, urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium, serum cholesterol, serum bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (SGOT), alanine aminotransferase (SGPT), albumin, and globulin estimations were performed. The patients were followed up for a maximum period of 30 days from the onset of stroke, and patients who expired were grouped as 'expired' and the rest as 'survivors'. Logistic regression analysis was carried out among the significant parameters to identify independent predictors of 30-day fatality. RESULTS: Univariate analysis demonstrated that among hematological parameters, high total leukocyte count and ESR, at admission, correlated significantly with an undesirable outcome during the initial 30 days. Among biochemical parameters, elevated urea, creatinine, serum transaminases (SGOT and SGPT) and globulin levels correlated significantly with death. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that a low Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score along with biochemical parameters such as high serum creatinine, SGPT, ESR and total leukocyte count correlated with death. CONCLUSION: Impaired consciousness, high total leukocyte count, raised ESR, elevated creatinine and SGPT levels, estimated within 24 hours of hospitalization, are the most important indicators of 30-day mortality in patients with first-time ischemic stroke.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Appropriate use of diagnostic laboratory tests is challenging, and estimates of 20\% for overutilization and 45\% for underutilization have been reported. Introducing effective and sustainable solutions to stimulate optimal use of laboratory testing in clinical practice is a challenge. A recent pilot study from our group, focusing on increasing the awareness about appropriate laboratory testing with the aim of changing the mindset of health care workers, has shown promising results. In this project, we aim to extend this multistep intervention to the internal medicine departments of 4 large Dutch hospitals. We aim to reduce unnecessary laboratory testing by 5\%. OBJECTIVE: Our primary objective is to determine the effect of our intervention on diagnostic laboratory test order volume. Our secondary objectives are to determine the effect of our intervention on laboratory expenditure and order volumes, expenditures for other diagnostic modalities, and clinical patient outcomes. We will also analyze the barriers and facilitators for deimplementation of unnecessary laboratory testing. METHODS: The main interventions of this before-after study will be an intensified supervision of residents by experienced physicians regarding test ordering, creating awareness through education and monthly feedback on ordering patterns, and changes in (computerized) order entry systems. RESULTS: At the time of publication of this protocol, the project is in the phase of data collection. We expect to present data on reduction early in the fourth quarter of 2018. CONCLUSIONS: In this project, we aim to reduce the unnecessary diagnostic testing in the internal medicine departments of 4 teaching hospitals. Although the main interventions will be similar, each clinic is given the opportunity to focus on the specific facets of the interventions as deemed useful according to the local situation. If effective, the study provides a framework for a nationwide initiative for reducing inappropriate laboratory testing. REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER: RR1-10.2106/10473.},

  abstract = {Background: Vascular Cognitive Impairment (VCI) refers to cognitive dysfunction due to vascular brain injury, as a single cause or in combination with other, often neurodegenerative, etiologies. VCI is a broad construct that captures a heterogeneous patient population both in terms of cognitive and noncognitive symptoms and in terms of etiology and prognosis. This provides a challenge when applying this construct in clinical practice. Objective: This paper presents the rationale and design of the TRACE-VCI study, which investigates the clinical features and prognosis of VCI in a memory clinic setting. Methods: The TRACE-VCI project is an observational, prospective cohort study of 861 consecutive memory clinic patients with possible VCI. Between 2009 and 2013, patients were recruited through the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort of the VU University Medical Centre (VUMC) (N=665) and the outpatient memory clinic and VCI cohort of the University Medical Centre Utrecht (UMCU) (N=196). We included all patients attending the clinics with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of vascular brain injury. Patients with a primary etiology other than vascular brain injury or neurodegeneration were excluded. Patients underwent an extensive 1-day memory clinic evaluation including an interview, physical and neurological examination, assessment of biomarkers (including those for Alzheimer-type pathologies), extensive neuropsychological testing, and an MRI scan of the brain. For prognostic analyses, the composite primary outcome measure was defined as accelerated cognitive decline (change of clinical dementia rating {$\geq$}1 or institutionalization) or (recurrent) major vascular events or death over the course of 2 years. Results: The mean age at baseline was 67.7 (SD 8.5) years and 46.3\% of patients (399/861) were female. At baseline, the median Clinical Dementia Rating was 0.5 (interquartile range [IQR] 0.5-1.0) and the median Mini-Mental State Examination score was 25 (IQR 22-28). The clinical diagnosis at baseline was dementia in 52.4\% of patients (451/861), mild cognitive impairment in 24.6\% (212/861), and no objective cognitive impairment in the remaining 23.0\% (198/861). Conclusions: The TRACE-VCI study represents a large cohort of well-characterized patients with VCI in a memory clinic setting. Data processing and collection for follow-up are currently being completed. The TRACE-VCI study will provide insight into the clinical features of memory clinic patients that meet VCI criteria and establish key prognostic factors for further cognitive decline and (recurrent) major vascular events.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Cerebral small vessel disease is increasingly linked to dementia. METHODS: We systematically searched Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases for prospective population-based studies addressing associations of white matter hyperintensities, covert brain infarcts (i.e., clinically silent infarcts), and cerebral microbleeds with risk of all-dementia or Alzheimer's disease and performed meta-analyses. RESULTS: We identified 11 studies on white matter hyperintensities, covert brain infarcts, or cerebral microbleeds with risk of all-dementia or Alzheimer's disease. Pooled analyses showed an association of white matter hyperintensity volume and a borderline association of covert brain infarcts with risk of all-dementia (hazard ratio: 1.39 [95\% confidence interval: 1.00; 1.94], N~=~3913, and 1.47 [95\% confidence interval: 0.97; 2.22], N~=~8296). Microbleeds were not statistically significantly associated with an increased risk of all-dementia (hazard ratio: 1.25 [95\% confidence interval: 0.66; 2.38], N~=~8739). DISCUSSION: White matter hyperintensities are associated with an increased risk of all-dementia and Alzheimer's disease in the general population. However, studies are warranted to further determine the role of markers of cerebral small vessel disease in dementia.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Upon activation, neutrophils can release nuclear material known as neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which were initially described as a part of antimicrobial defense. Extracellular chromatin was recently reported to be prothrombotic in vitro and to accumulate in plasma and thrombi of baboons with experimental deep vein thrombosis (DVT). OBJECTIVE: To explore the source and role of extracellular chromatin in DVT. METHODS: We used an established murine model of DVT induced by flow restriction (stenosis) in the inferior vena cava (IVC). RESULTS: We demonstrate that the levels of extracellular DNA increase in plasma after 6 h IVC stenosis, compared with sham-operated mice. Immunohistochemical staining revealed the presence of Gr-1-positive neutrophils in both red (RBC-rich) and white (platelet-rich) parts of thrombi. Citrullinated histone H3 (CitH3), an element of NETs' structure, was present only in the red part of thrombi and was frequently associated with the Gr-1 antigen. Immunofluorescent staining of thrombi showed proximity of extracellular CitH3 and von Willebrand factor (VWF), a platelet adhesion molecule crucial for thrombus development in this model. Infusion of Deoxyribonuclease 1 (DNase 1) protected mice from DVT after 6 h and also 48 h IVC stenosis. Infusion of an unfractionated mixture of calf thymus histones increased plasma VWF and promoted DVT early after stenosis application. CONCLUSIONS: Extracellular chromatin, likely originating from neutrophils, is a structural part of a venous thrombus and both the DNA scaffold and histones appear to contribute to the pathogenesis of DVT in mice. NETs may provide new targets for DVT drug development.},

Here, we describe that, upon activation, neutrophils release granule proteins and chromatin that together form extracellular fibers that bind Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. These neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) degrade virulence factors and kill bacteria. NETs are abundant in vivo in experimental dysentery and spontaneous human appendicitis, two examples of acute inflammation. NETs appear to be a form of innate response that binds microorganisms, prevents them from spreading, and ensures a high local concentration of antimicrobial agents to degrade virulence factors and kill bacteria.},

  abstract = {Because hypoperfusion of brain tissue precedes atrophy in dementia, the detection of dementia may be advanced by the use of perfusion information. Such information can be obtained noninvasively with arterial spin labeling (ASL), a relatively new MR technique quantifying cerebral blood flow (CBF). Using ASL and structural MRI, we evaluated diagnostic classification in 32 prospectively included presenile early stage dementia patients and 32 healthy controls. Patients were suspected of Alzheimer's disease (AD) or frontotemporal dementia. Classification was based on CBF as perfusion marker, gray matter (GM) volume as atrophy marker, and their combination. These markers were each examined using six feature extraction methods: a voxel-wise method and a region of interest (ROI)-wise approach using five ROI-sets in the GM. These ROI-sets ranged in number from 72 brain regions to a single ROI for the entire supratentorial brain. Classification was performed with a linear support vector machine classifier. For validation of the classification method on the basis of GM features, a reference dataset from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative database was used consisting of AD patients and healthy controls. In our early stage dementia population, the voxelwise feature-extraction approach achieved more accurate results (area under the curve (AUC) range\,=\,86\,-\,91\%) than all other approaches (AUC\,=\,57\,-\,84\%). Used in isolation, CBF quantified with ASL was a good diagnostic marker for dementia. However, our findings indicated only little added diagnostic value when combining ASL with the structural MRI data (AUC\,=\,91\%), which did not significantly improve over accuracy of structural MRI atrophy marker by itself.},

  abstract = {We describe here the use of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), an algorithm based on decomposition by parts that can reduce the dimension of expression data from thousands of genes to a handful of metagenes. Coupled with a model selection mechanism, adapted to work for any stochastic clustering algorithm, NMF is an efficient method for identification of distinct molecular patterns and provides a powerful method for class discovery. We demonstrate the ability of NMF to recover meaningful biological information from cancer-related microarray data. NMF appears to have advantages over other methods such as hierarchical clustering or self-organizing maps. We found it less sensitive to               a priori               selection of genes or initial conditions and able to detect alternative or context-dependent patterns of gene expression in complex biological systems. This ability, similar to semantic polysemy in text, provides a general method for robust molecular pattern discovery.},

  abstract = {Background High neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is associated with poor prognosis in ischemic stroke. However, the role of NLR in cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is controversial. Herein, we evaluated the value of NLR in identifying CSVD and its relationship with the common imaging markers of CSVD. Methods A total of 667 patients were enrolled in this study, including 368 in the CSVD group and 299 in the non-CSVD group. Clinical, laboratory, and imaging data were collected. The relationship of NLR with CSVD and common imaging markers of CSVD were analyzed with univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. The predictive value of NLR was assessed with the receiver operating characteristic curve. Results NLR (odds ratio [OR] = 1.929, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.599--2.327, p {$<$} .001) was an independent risk factor for CSVD. NLR was also independently associated with moderate to severe white matter hyperintensity (WMH) (OR = 2.136, 95\% CI = 1.768--2.580, p {$<$} .001), moderate to severe periventricular WMH (OR = 2.138, 95\% CI = 1.771--2.579, p {$<$} .001), and moderate to severe deep WMH (OR = 1.654, 95\% CI = 1.438--1.902, p {$<$} .001), moderately to severely enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS) (OR = 1.248, 95\% CI = 1.110--1.402, p {$<$} .001), moderately to severely EPVS in the basal ganglia (OR = 1.136, 95\% CI = 1.012--1.275, p = .030), and moderately to severely EPVS in the centrum semiovale (OR = 1.140, 95\% CI = 1.027--1.266, p = .014). However, NLR was not statistically significantly associated with lacune. The optimal cutoff point of NLR in predicting CSVD was 2.47, with sensitivity and specificity of 84.2\% and 66.9\%, respectively (p {$<$} .01). The diagnostic effect was maximized when NLR was combined with other risk factors. Conclusions NLR is an independent risk factor for CSVD and is independently associated with common imaging markers of CSVD. NLR may serve as a valid and convenient biomarker for assessing CSVD.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment and dementia are associated with a range of cardiovascular conditions, including hypertension, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. We aimed to describe the association with heart failure, summarizing published data to give estimates of prevalence, incidence, and relative risk of cognitive impairment/dementia in heart failure. METHODS: We searched multidisciplinary databases including MEDLINE (OVID), EMBASE (OVID), CINAHL (EBSCO), PsychINFO (EBSCO), Web of Science (Thomson Reuters), and CENTRAL (Cochrane Library) from inception until May 31, 2015. All relevant studies looking at cognitive impairment/dementia in heart failure were included. Studies were selected by 2 independent reviewers using prespecified inclusion/exclusion criteria. Where data allowed, we performed meta-analysis and pooled results using random effects models. RESULTS: From 18,000 titles, 37 studies were eligible (n\,=\,8411 participants). Data from 4 prospective cohorts (n\,=\,2513 participants) suggest greater cognitive decline in heart failure compared with non-heart failure over the longer term. These data were not suitable for meta-analysis. In case control studies describing those with and without heart failure (n\,=\,4 papers, 1414 participants) the odds ratio for cognitive impairment in the heart failure population was 1.67 (95\% confidence interval 1.15-2.42). Prevalence of cognitive impairment in heart failure cohorts (n\,=\,26 studies, 4176 participants) was 43\% (95\% confidence interval 30-55). CONCLUSIONS: This review suggests a substantial proportion of patients with heart failure have concomitant cognitive problems. This has implications for planning treatment and services. These data do not allow us to comment on causation, and further work is needed to describe the underlying pathophysiology.},

Driven by a recent analysis of the MR CLEAN trial, which showed a higher benefit from acute stroke endovascular treatment (EVT) in males, we intended to determine if clinical outcomes after EVT differ between sexes, in a \emph{real-world} setting. \textbf{\emph{Methods:}} We analyzed 145 consecutive patients submitted to EVT for anterior circulation large-vessel occlusion, between January 2015 and September 2016, and compared the outcomes between sexes. \textbf{\emph{Results:}} Our population was represented by 81 (55.9\%) females, with similar baseline characteristics (pre-stroke disability, baseline NIHSS, and ASPECTS), rate of previous intravenous thrombolysis, time from onset to recanalization, and rate of revascularization; with the exception that women were on average 4 years older and had more hypertension, and men in turn had more tandem occlusions and atherosclerotic etiology (all \emph{p} {$<$} 0.05). Even after adjusting for these statistically significant variables and for intravenous thrombolysis (as some studies advocate a different response to this treatment between sexes), there were no differences in intracranial hemorrhage, functional independence (mRS {$\leq$}2 in 60.9\% males vs. 66.7\% in females, \emph{p} = 0.48; adjusted \emph{p} = 0.36), or mortality at 3 months. \textbf{\emph{Conclusion:}} In a \emph{real-world }setting, we found no sex differences in clinical and safety outcomes after acute stroke EVT. Our results support the idea that women are equally likely to achieve good outcomes as men after acute stroke EVT.},

  abstract = {Background and purpose: We sought to investigate whether there are gender differences in clinical outcome after stroke due to large vessel occlusion (LVO) after mechanical thrombectomy (EVT) in a large population of real-world patients. Methods: From the Italian Registry of Endovascular Thrombectomy, we extracted clinical and outcome data of patients treated for stroke due to large vessel occlusion. We compared clinical and safety outcomes in men and women who underwent EVT alone or in combination with intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in the total population and in a Propensity Score matched set. Results: Among 3422 patients included in the study, 1801 (52.6\%) were women. Despite older age at onset (mean 72.4 vs 68.7; p\,{$<$}\,0.001), and higher rate of atrial fibrillation (41.7\% vs 28.6\%; p\,{$<$}\,0.001), women had higher probability of 3-month functional independence (adjusted odds ratio-adjOR 1.19; 95\% CI 1.02-1.38), of complete recanalization (adjOR 1.25; 95\% CI 1.09-1.44) and lower probability of death (adjOR 0.75; 95\% CI 0.62-0.90). After propensity-score matching, a well-balanced cohort comprising 1150\,men and 1150\,women was analyzed, confirming the same results regarding functional outcome (3-month functional independence: OR 1.25; 95\% CI 1.04-1.51), and complete recanalization (OR 1.29; 95\% CI 1.09-1.53). Conclusions: Subject to the limitations of a non-randomized comparison, women with stroke due to LVO treated with mechanical thrombectomy had a better chance to achieve complete recanalization, and 3-month functional independence than men. The results could be driven by women who underwent combined treatment.},

The aim of this study was to determine the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scores of patients with CSX and to compare with healthy controls. Materials/Subjects and Methods: Patients undergoing coronary angiography between January 2015 and December 2016 because of clinical indications, including abnormal noninvasive test results were examined. Two hundred and 10 subjects (110 patients with CSX, 100 controls) were enrolled. Demographic characteristics including age, education level, marriage status, and history of stressful life events were recorded. The Turkish version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale was evaluated in the study population. RESULTS: Anxiety, depression, and total scores in the patients with CSX were significantly higher than those in the control group (p {$<$} 0.001, p {$<$} 0.003, p {$<$} 0.001, respectively). Among women, anxiety, depression, total scores, and stressful life events were significantly higher in the CSX group (p = 0.006, p = 0.015, p = 0.001, p {$<$} 0.001, respectively). Patients with lower educational status had higher anxiety scores (p = 0.03), stressful life events, and HAD-A {$>$} 10 were the only independent predictors of CSX in logistic regression analysis with comparable ORs 2.256 (95\% CI 1.057-4.817, p = 0.03) and 2,399 (95\% CI 1.248-4.613, p = 0.009) respectively. CONCLUSION: The results of our research suggest that patients with CSX have a high prevalence of stress and psychiatric disturbances. Interventions targeted toward improving the quality of life and to give psychological support may have the potential benefits especially for women and individuals with lower education.},

Background               Recent studies suggested that headache disorders may increase the risk for dementia. However, available studies are conflicting.                                         Methods                                To identify qualifying studies, we searched scientific databases, including                 Pubmed                 ,                 Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct                 and                 BMC,                 screening for relevant papers. In order to reduce the heterogeneity between different studies, the analyses were further subdivided according to the clinical diagnoses and the study methodologies.                                                        Results                                We identified 23 studies investigating the association between primary headaches and the risk of dementia. Of these, 18 met our inclusion criteria for meta-analysis (covering 924.140 individuals). Overall effect-size shows that primary headaches were associated with a small increase in dementia risk (OR\,=\,1,15; CI 95\%: 1,03--1,28;                 p                 \,=\,0,02). Analyzing subgroups, we found that migraine was associated with both a moderate increased risk of all-cause dementia (OR\,=\,1,26;                 p                 \,=\,0,00; 95\% CI: 1,13--1,40) as well as a moderate increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (OR\,=\,2,00;                 p                 \,=\,0,00; 95\% CI: 1,46--2,75). This association was significant in both case--control and retrospective cohort studies but not in prospective studies.                                                        Conclusions               Our study supports the presence of a link between primary headaches and dementia.

Factors that affect dropout may well be similar from one study to another. This article systematically reviews all large population-based studies of the elderly (published 1966--2002) that report on differences in individual characteristics between people who remain and people who dropout at follow-up. Study design and setting A systematic review of articles that investigate attrition after baseline interview. Results Twelve studies were found that investigated dropout other than death using unadjusted, multivariable methods or both. The unadjusted analyses showed many significant factors related to attrition. Multivariable analyses showed two main independent factors were related to increased attrition: increasing age and cognitive impairment. People who were very ill or frail had higher dropout rates, and people in worse health were less likely to be recontactable. Conclusions Multivariable methods of analyzing attrition in longitudinal studies show consistent patterns of dropout between differing studies, with a small number of key relationships. These findings will assist researchers when planning studies of older people, and provide insight into the possible biases in longitudinal studies introduced by differential dropout.},

  abstract = {Clustering of variables is as a way to arrange variables into homogeneous clusters, i.e., groups of variables which are strongly related to each other and thus bring the same information. These approaches can then be useful for dimension reduction and variable selection. Several specific methods have been developed for the clustering of numerical variables. However concerning qualitative variables or mixtures of quantitative and qualitative variables, far fewer methods have been proposed. The R package ClustOfVar was specifically developed for this purpose. The homogeneity criterion of a cluster is defined as the sum of correlation ratios (for qualitative variables) and squared correlations (for quantitative variables) to a synthetic quantitative variable, summarizing "as good as possible" the variables in the cluster. This synthetic variable is the first principal component obtained with the PCAMIX method. Two algorithms for the clustering of variables are proposed: iterative relocation algorithm and ascendant hierarchical clustering. We also propose a bootstrap approach in order to determine suitable numbers of clusters. We illustrate the methodologies and the associated package on small datasets.},

  abstract = {The critical importance of justifying the inclusion of covariates is a facet often overlooked in data analysis. While the incorporation of covariates typically follows informal guidelines, we argue for a comprehensive exploration of underlying principles to avoid significant statistical and interpretational challenges. Our focus is on addressing three common yet problematic practices: the indiscriminate lumping of covariates, the lack of rationale for covariate inclusion, and the oversight of potential issues in result reporting. These challenges, prevalent in neuroimaging models involving covariates such as reaction time, demographics, and morphometric measures, can introduce biases, including overestimation, underestimation, masking, sign flipping, or spurious effects. Our exploration of causal inference principles underscores the pivotal role of domain knowledge in guiding covariate selection, challenging the common reliance on statistical measures. This understanding carries implications for experimental design, model-building, and result interpretation. We draw connections between these insights and reproducibility concerns, specifically addressing the selection bias resulting from the widespread practice of strict thresholding, akin to the logical pitfall associated with ``double dipping.'' Recommendations for robust data analysis involving covariates encompass explicit research question statements, justified covariate inclusions/exclusions, centering quantitative variables for interpretability, appropriate reporting of effect estimates, and advocating a ``highlight, don't hide'' approach in result reporting. These suggestions are intended to enhance the robustness, transparency, and reproducibility of covariate-driven analyses, encompassing investigations involving consortium datasets such as ABCD and UK Biobank. We discuss how researchers can use a transparent depiction of the covariate relationships to enhance the ethos of open science and promote research reproducibility.},

Therefore, this study aimed to examine the incidence of mental symptoms in patients with angiographic exclusion of a coronary heart disease. DESIGN: In 253 patients with angiographic exclusion of a coronary heart disease the type and intensity of their symptoms were evaluated before and after coronary angiography. In addition, the incidence of psychopathological symptoms was quantified by standardised questionnaires such as general anxiety and depression (HADS), heart-focused anxiety (CAQ), hypochondria (Whiteley Index) and somatoform disorder (SOMS) and quality of life (SF-12). Finally, the incidence of psychological symptoms in these patients was compared to the incidence in the normal population. RESULTS: Despite the absence of a coronary artery disease, 70\% of patients continue to suffer from cardiac symptoms. The incidence of general anxiety was increased by 37\% in women and by 22\% in men in comparison to the normal population. Heart-focused anxiety was raised by 27\%. Somatoform disorder appeared 120\% more often in patients after cardiac catheterisation in comparison to the normal population. In addition, the incidence of hypochondria was elevated by 68\% in patients after coronary angiography compared to normal population. This increased appearance of psychological symptoms was reflected in a significantly lower quality of life (SF-12) in patients with inconspicuous coronary angiography. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cardiac symptoms and normal coronary arteries more often suffer from mental symptoms in comparison to the healthy population.},

We characterized the mechanical properties and composition of thromboemboli from clinical cases and compared them with commonly used EAs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thromboemboli were obtained from patients with AIS by using aspiration devices and from carotid atherosclerotic plaques harvested during endarterectomy. In the laboratory, common EAs were created by varying blood donor species (human, porcine, and bovine), thrombin concentration, and presence of barium sulfate. Stiffness and elasticity of the specimens were measured with DMA. Scanning electron microscopy and histology were used to investigate the ultrastructure and composition of all specimens. RESULTS: Red thromboemboli from patients composed mainly of fibrin and erythrocytes were much softer than the calcified and cholesterol-rich material. Of the EAs created in the laboratory, those made from bovine blood presented the highest stiffness that was independent of thrombin concentration. Addition of thrombin increased the stiffness and elasticity of human and porcine EAs (P {$<$} .05). The presence of barium sulfate significantly reduced the elasticity of all EAs (P {$<$} .05). CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular device testing and development requires realistic EAs. The stiffness and elasticity of the cerebral thromboemboli analyzed in this study were closely matched by recalcified porcine EAs and thrombin-induced human EAs. Stiffness of the thrombus extracted from carotid endarterectomy specimens was similar with that of the thrombin-induced bovine and porcine EAs.},

  abstract = {Introduction The spatial distribution of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on MRI is often considered in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with cognitive problems. In some patients, clinicians may classify WMH patterns as ``unusual'', but this is largely based on expert opinion, because detailed quantitative information about WMH distribution frequencies in a memory clinic setting is lacking. Here we report voxel wise 3D WMH distribution frequencies in a large multicenter dataset and also aimed to identify individuals with unusual WMH patterns. Methods Individual participant data (N~=~3525, including 777 participants with subjective cognitive decline, 1389 participants with mild cognitive impairment and 1359 patients with dementia) from eleven memory clinic cohorts, recruited through the Meta VCI Map Consortium, were used. WMH segmentations were provided by participating centers or performed in Utrecht and registered to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)-152 brain template for spatial normalization. To determine WMH distribution frequencies, we calculated WMH probability maps at voxel level. To identify individuals with unusual WMH patterns, region-of-interest (ROI) based WMH probability maps, rule-based scores, and a machine learning method (Local Outlier Factor (LOF)), were implemented. Results WMH occurred in 82\% of voxels from the white matter template with large variation between subjects. Only a small proportion of the white matter (1.7\%), mainly in the periventricular areas, was affected by WMH in at least 20\% of participants. A large portion of the total white matter was affected infrequently. Nevertheless, 93.8\% of individual participants had lesions in voxels that were affected in less than 2\% of the population, mainly located in subcortical areas. Only the machine learning method effectively identified individuals with unusual patterns, in particular subjects with asymmetric WMH distribution or with WMH at relatively rarely affected locations despite common locations not being affected. Discussion Aggregating data from several memory clinic cohorts, we provide a detailed 3D map of WMH lesion distribution frequencies, that informs on common as well as rare localizations. The use of data-driven analysis with LOF can be used to identify unusual patterns, which might serve as an alert that rare causes of WMH should be considered.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: The project assembled a pool of datasets from 12 European cohort studies, mainly carried out in general population settings. There were 20,5178 persons (88,080 women and 11,7098 men) representing 2.7 million person years of follow-up. There were 7934 cardiovascular deaths, of which 5652 were deaths from coronary heart disease. Ten-year risk of fatal cardiovascular disease was calculated using a Weibull model in which age was used as a measure of exposure time to risk rather than as a risk factor. Separate estimation equations were calculated for coronary heart disease and for non-coronary cardiovascular disease. These were calculated for high-risk and low-risk regions of Europe. Two parallel estimation models were developed, one based on total cholesterol and the other on total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio. The risk estimations are displayed graphically in simple risk charts. Predictive value of the risk charts was examined by applying them to persons aged 45-64; areas under ROC curves ranged from 0.71 to 0.84. CONCLUSIONS: The SCORE risk estimation system offers direct estimation of total fatal cardiovascular risk in a format suited to the constraints of clinical practice.},

Currently, its diagnosis and treatment remains a challenge for practitioners. To provide an overview of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, natural history, diagnosis, and therapy of Mixed Vascular-Alzheimer Dementia (MVAD). The literature was reviewed for articles published between 1990-2016 by using the keywords linked to MVAD. Neuropathological studies indicate that MVAD is a very common pathological finding in the elderly with a prevalence about of 22\%. The distinction between Alzheimer's dementia and vascular dementia (VD) is complex because their clinical presentation can overlap. There are international criteria for the MVAD diagnosis. The pharmacologic therapy shows modest clinical benefits that are similar among all drugs used in patients with Alzheimer's dementia and VD. The non-pharmacologic therapy includes the rigorous management of cardiovascular risk factors (especially hypertension) and the promotion of a healthy diet. The diagnosis and treatment of MVAD cannot be improved without further studies. Currently available medications provide only modest clinical benefits once a patient has developed MVAD. In subjects at risk, the antihypertensive therapy and healthy diet should be recommend for preventing or slowing the progression of MVAD.},

  abstract = {Inflammation has been implicated as a secondary injury mechanism following ischemia and stroke. A variety of experimental models, including thromboembolic stroke, focal and global ischemia, have been used to evaluate the importance of inflammation. The vasculature endothelium promotes inflammation through the upregulation of adhesion molecules such as ICAM, E-selectin, and P-selectin that bind to circulating leukocytes and facilitate their migration into the CNS. Once in the CNS, the production of cytotoxic molecules may facilitate cell death. The macrophage and microglial response to injury may either be beneficial by scavenging necrotic debris or detrimental by facilitating cell death in neurons that would otherwise recover. While many studies have tested these hypotheses, the importance of inflammation in these models is inconclusive. This review summarizes data regarding the role of the vasculature, leukocytes, blood-brain barrier, macrophages, and microglia after experimental and clinical stroke.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Purpose               The aim of this study was to analyze sex differences in outcome after thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke in clinical practice in a~large prospective multicenter registry.                                         Methods               Data of consecutive stroke patients treated with thrombectomy (June 2015--April 2018) derived from an industry-independent registry (German Stroke Registry--Endovascular Treatment) were prospectively analyzed. Multivariable binary logistic regression analyses were applied to determine whether sex is a~predictor of functional independence outcome (defined as a~modified Rankin scale [mRS] 0--2) 90~days after stroke.                                         Results                                In total, 2316~patients were included in the analysis, 1170 (50.5\%) were female and 1146 (49.5\%) were male. Women were older (median age 78 vs. 72~years;                 p                 \,{$<$}\,0.001) and more frequently had a~prestroke functional impairment defined by mRS {$>$}1 (24.8\% vs. 14.1\%;                 p                 \,{$<$}\,0.001). In unadjusted analyses, independent outcome at 90~days was less frequent in women (33.2\%) than men (40.6\%;                 p                 \,{$<$}\,0.001). Likewise, mortality was higher in women than in men (30.7\% vs. 26.4\%;                 p                 \,=\,0.024). In adjusted regression analyses, however, sex was not associated with outcome. Lower age, a~lower baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, a~higher Alberta Stroke Program Early CT score, prestroke functional independence, successful reperfusion, and concomitant intravenous thrombolysis therapy predicted independent outcome.                                                        Conclusion               Women showed a~worse functional outcome after thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke in clinical practice; however, after adjustment for crucial confounders sex was not a predictor of outcome. The difference in outcome thus appears to result from differences in confounding factors such as age and prestroke functional status.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Covert vascular brain injury (VBI) is highly prevalent in community-dwelling older persons, but its clinical and therapeutic implications are debated. OBJECTIVE: To better understand the clinical significance of VBI to optimize prevention strategies for the most common age-related neurological diseases, stroke and dementia. DATA SOURCE: We searched for articles in PubMed between 1966 and December 22, 2017, studying the association of 4 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers of covert VBI (white matter hyperintensities [WMHs] of presumed vascular origin, MRI-defined covert brain infarcts [BIs], cerebral microbleeds [CMBs], and perivascular spaces [PVSs]) with incident stroke, dementia, or death. STUDY SELECTION: Data were taken from prospective, longitudinal cohort studies including 50 or more adults. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: We performed inverse variance-weighted meta-analyses with random effects and z score-based meta-analyses for WMH burden. The significance threshold was P\,{$<$}\,.003 (17 independent tests). We complied with the Meta-analyses of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Stroke (hemorrhagic and ischemic), dementia (all and Alzheimer disease), and death. RESULTS: Of 2846 articles identified, 94 studies were eligible, with up to 14 529 participants for WMH, 16 012 participants for BI, 15 693 participants for CMB, and 4587 participants for PVS. Extensive WMH burden was associated with higher risk of incident stroke (hazard ratio [HR], 2.45; 95\% CI, 1.93-3.12; P\,{$<$}\,.001), ischemic stroke (HR, 2.39; 95\% CI, 1.65-3.47; P\,{$<$}\,.001), intracerebral hemorrhage (HR, 3.17; 95\% CI, 1.54-6.52; P\,=\,.002), dementia (HR, 1.84; 95\% CI, 1.40-2.43; P\,{$<$}\,.001), Alzheimer disease (HR, 1.50; 95\% CI, 1.22-1.84; P\,{$<$}\,.001), and death (HR, 2.00; 95\% CI, 1.69-2.36; P\,{$<$}\,.001). Presence of MRI-defined BIs was associated with higher risk of incident stroke (HR, 2.38; 95\% CI, 1.87-3.04; P\,{$<$}\,.001), ischemic stroke (HR, 2.18; 95\% CI, 1.67-2.85; P\,{$<$}\,.001), intracerebral hemorrhage (HR, 3.81; 95\% CI, 1.75-8.27; P\,{$<$}\,.001), and death (HR, 1.64; 95\% CI, 1.40-1.91; P\,{$<$}\,.001). Presence of CMBs was associated with increased risk of stroke (HR, 1.98; 95\% CI, 1.55-2.53; P\,{$<$}\,.001), ischemic stroke (HR, 1.92; 95\% CI, 1.40-2.63; P\,{$<$}\,.001), intracerebral hemorrhage (HR, 3.82; 95\% CI, 2.15-6.80; P\,{$<$}\,.001), and death (HR, 1.53; 95\% CI, 1.31-1.80; P\,{$<$}\,.001). Data on PVS were limited and insufficient to conduct meta-analyses but suggested an association of high PVS burden with increased risk of stroke, dementia, and death; this requires confirmation. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We report evidence that MRI markers of VBI have major clinical significance. This research prompts careful evaluation of the benefit-risk ratio for available prevention strategies in individuals with covert VBI.},

  abstract = {Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) is a leading cause of stroke and dementia with no specific mechanism-based treatment. We used Mendelian randomization to combine a unique cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma pQTL resource with the latest European-ancestry GWAS of MRI-markers of cSVD (white matter hyperintensities, perivascular spaces). We describe a new biological fingerprint of 49 protein-cSVD associations, predominantly in the CSF. We implemented a multipronged follow-up, across fluids, platforms, and ancestries (Europeans and East-Asian), including testing associations of direct plasma protein measurements with MRI-cSVD. We highlight 16 proteins robustly associated in both CSF and plasma, with 24/4 proteins identified in CSF/plasma only. cSVD-proteins were enriched in extracellular matrix and immune response pathways, and in genes enriched in microglia and specific microglial states (integration with single-nucleus RNA sequencing). Immune-related proteins were associated with MRI-cSVD already at age twenty. Half of cSVD-proteins were associated with stroke, dementia, or both, and seven cSVD-proteins are targets for known drugs (used for other indications in directions compatible with beneficial therapeutic effects. This first cSVD proteogenomic signature opens new avenues for biomarker and therapeutic developments.},

  abstract = {Objective---                              Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is a major burden to health care. Because atherosclerosis is considered a systemic disease, we hypothesized that one single atherosclerotic plaque contains ample molecular information that predicts future cardiovascular events in all vascular territories.                                                          Methods and Results---                              AtheroExpress is a biobank collecting atherosclerotic lesions during surgery, with a 3-year follow-up. The composite primary outcome encompasses all cardiovascular events and interventions, eg, cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and endovascular interventions. A proteomics search identified osteopontin as a potential plaque biomarker. Patients undergoing carotid surgery (n=574) served as the cohort in which plaque osteopontin levels were examined in relation to their outcome during follow-up and was validated in a cohort of patients undergoing femoral endarterectomy (n=151). Comparing the highest quartile of carotid plaque osteopontin levels with quartile 1 showed a hazard ratio for the primary outcome of 3.8 (95\% confidence interval, 2.6--5.9). The outcome did not change after adjustment for plaque characteristics and traditional risk factors (hazard ratio, 3.5; 95\% confidence interval, 2.0--5.9). The femoral validation cohort showed a hazard ratio of 3.8 (95\% confidence interval 2.0 to 7.4) comparing osteopontin levels in quartile 4 with quartile 1.                                                          Conclusion---                              Plaque osteopontin levels in single lesions are predictive for cardiovascular events in other vascular territories. Local atherosclerotic plaques are a source of prognostic biomarkers with a high predictive value for secondary manifestations of atherosclerotic disease.                        ,              Using a large collection of human plaque atherectomy specimens with patient follow-up, this proof-of-concept study showed that osteopontin and macrophage migration inhibitory factor protein levels in local plaques are associated with adverse cardiovascular events elsewhere in the body during follow-up.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: White matter lesions are often seen on MR scans of elderly non-demented and demented people. They are attributed to degenerative changes of small vessels and are implicated in the pathogenesis of cognitive decline and dementia. There is evidence that especially periventricular white matter lesions are related to cognitive decline, whereas subcortical white matter lesions may be related to late onset depression. The frequency distribution of subcortical and periventricular white matter lesions according to age and sex reported. METHODS: A total of 1077 subjects aged between 60-90 years were randomly sampled from the general population. All subjects underwent 1.5T MR scanning; white matter lesions were rated separately for the subcortical region and the periventricular region. RESULTS: Of all subjects 8\% were completely free of subcortical white matter lesions, 20\% had no periventricular white matter lesions, and 5\% had no white matter lesions in either of these locations. The proportion with white matter lesions increased with age, similarly for men and women. Women tended to have more subcortical white matter lesions than men (total volume 1.45 ml v 1. 29 ml; p=0.33), mainly caused by marked differences in the frontal white matter lesion volume (0.89 ml v 0.70 ml; p=0.08). Periventricular white matter lesions were also more frequent among women than men (mean grade 2.5 v 2.3; p=0.07). Also severe degrees of subcortical white matter lesions were more common in women than in men (OR 1.1; 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) 0.8-1.5) and periventricular white matter lesions (OR 1.2; 95\% CI 0.9-1.7), albeit that none of these findings were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence and the degree of cerebral white matter lesions increased with age. Women tended to have a higher degree of white matter lesions than men. This may underlie the finding of a higher incidence of dementia in women than in men, particularly at later age.},

  abstract = {In cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD), whole brain MRI markers of cSVD-related brain injury explain limited variance to support individualized prediction. Here, we investigate whether considering abnormalities in brain tracts by integrating multimodal metrics from diffusion MRI (dMRI) and structural MRI (sMRI), can better capture cognitive performance in cSVD patients than established approaches based on whole brain markers. We selected 102 patients (73.7\,{\textpm}\,10.2~years old, 59 males) with MRI-visible SVD lesions and both sMRI and dMRI. Conventional linear models using demographics and established whole brain markers were used as benchmark of predicting individual cognitive scores. Multi-modal metrics of 73 major brain tracts were derived from dMRI and sMRI, and used together with established markers as input of a feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN) to predict individual cognitive scores. A feature selection strategy was implemented to reduce the risk of overfitting. Prediction was performed with leave-one-out cross-validation and evaluated with the R2 of the correlation between measured and predicted cognitive scores. Linear models predicted memory and processing speed with R2\,=\,0.26 and R2\,=\,0.38, respectively. With ANN, feature selection resulted in 13 tract-specific metrics and 5 whole brain markers for predicting processing speed, and 28 tract-specific metrics and 4 whole brain markers for predicting memory. Leave-one-out ANN prediction with the selected features achieved R2\,=\,0.49 and R2\,=\,0.40 for processing speed and memory, respectively. Our results show proof-of-concept that combining tract-specific multimodal MRI metrics can improve the prediction of cognitive performance in cSVD by leveraging tract-specific multi-modal metrics.},

The present study was conducted to demonstrate the mobilization of EPCs and its possible mechanism after acute ischemic stroke (AIS). A total of 148 individuals were examined, including 106 patients with ischemic stroke and 42 healthy controls. Seventy-one patients with imaging-confirmed AIS were examined at days 1, 7, 14, and 21 after stroke onset. Circulating EPCs were quantified by flow cytometry using CD133 and KDR surface markers. Serum stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Patients with AIS had significantly lower EPC level than that in the controls (0.022~{\textpm}~0.013 vs 0.051~{\textpm}~0.020; p~{$<~$}0.01). This difference did not remain significant after adjusting for risk factors at multivariate analysis. Blood pressure, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and fasting blood sugar were inversely correlated with EPC levels (p~{$<~$}0.01). Systolic blood pressure and LDL remained independent predictors of baseline EPC levels. The number of circulating EPCs increased on day 7 after AIS, reached a peak on day 14, and decreased on day 21. The concentration of SDF-1 had similar changes. The increment of EPCs was correlated with the infarct volume (r~=~0.708; p~=~0.006) and SDF-1 concentration on day 14 (r~=~0.714; p~{$<~$}0.001). Baseline EPC level in patients with AIS reflects the cumulative vascular endothelial damage. EPCs could be mobilized into peripheral circulation in response to stroke stress. This mobilization was associated with the increased expression of SDF-1.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Stroke etiology and outcome after ischemic stroke differ between men and women. We examined if sex modifies the effect of intra-arterial treatment (IAT) in a randomized clinical trial of IAT for acute ischemic stroke in the Netherlands (MR CLEAN). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The primary outcome was the score on the modified Rankin scale at 90 days. We tested for interaction between sex and treatment and estimated the treatment effect by sex with multiple ordinal logistic regression with adjustment for prognostic factors. RESULTS: All 500 patients were included in the analysis; 292 (58.4\%) were men. The treatment effect (adjusted common odds ratio) was 2.39 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.55-3.68] in men and 0.99 (95\% CI 0.60-1.66) in women (pinteraction = 0.016). In women, mortality was higher in the intervention group than in the control group (24 vs. 15\%, p = 0.07). Serious adverse events occurred more often in women than in men undergoing intervention. There were no differences in neuro-imaging outcomes. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Contrary to other studies, we found a significant interaction between sex and treatment effect in the MR CLEAN trial. Pooled analyses of all published thrombectomy trials did not confirm this finding. In MR CLEAN, women seem to have a slightly more unfavorable profile, causing higher mortality and more serious adverse events, but insufficient to explain the absence of an overall effect. This suggests a play of chance and makes it clear that IAT should not be withheld in women.},

The aim of this study was to investigate how plaque vulnerability is associated with NETs levels.

  abstract = {Neutrophils, a source of proteolytic enzymes and oxygen free radicals, have been shown to participate in animal models of myocardial ischemic injury. To characterize neutrophil activation in human ischemic heart disease, a specific neutrophil elastase-derived fibrinopeptide in plasma was measured in 25 patients with stable angina pectoris, 29 patients with unstable angina pectoris, 17 patients with acute myocardial infarction and 22 control subjects. Mean plasma levels (+/- standard error) of a neutrophil elastase-derived fibrinopeptide (B beta 30-43) measured by a specific radioimmunoassay were fivefold higher in patients with acute myocardial infarction (877 +/- 337 pmol/liter, p less than 0.02) and 13-fold higher in patients with unstable angina (2,277 +/- 613 pmol/liter, p less than 0.006) as compared with control subjects (172 +/- 74 pmol/liter). Mean plasma levels of peptide B beta 30-43 in patients with stable angina (676 +/- 334 pmol/liter), although higher than in control subjects, were not significantly increased (p = 0.64). Total leukocyte counts were 11.0 +/- 0.6 x 10(6)/ml in those with acute myocardial infarction, 9.2 +/- 0.7 x 10(6)/ml in those with unstable angina, 7.1 +/- 0.3 x 10(6)/ml in those with stable angina and 7.7 +/- 0.4 x 10(6)/ml in control subjects. Although total leukocyte counts in patients with unstable angina pectoris and acute myocardial infarction were higher (p less than 0.01) than in patients with stable angina or in control subjects, elevations in peptide B beta 30-43 levels were independent of the differences in both leukocyte count and absolute neutrophil count as well as in history of smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus or treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite the fact that 80\% of patients with heart failure are aged more than 65 years, recognition of cognitive impairment by physicians in this population has received relatively little attention. The current study evaluated physician documentation (as a measure of recognition) of cognitive impairment at the time of discharge in a cohort of older adults hospitalized for heart failure. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of older adults hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of heart failure. Cognitive status was evaluated with the Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination at the time of hospitalization. A score of 21 to 24 was used to indicate mild cognitive impairment, and a score of {$\leq$}20 was used to indicate moderate to severe impairment. To evaluate physician documentation of cognitive impairment, we used a standardized form with a targeted keyword strategy to review hospital discharge summaries. We calculated the proportion of patients with cognitive impairment documented as such by physicians and compared characteristics between groups with and without documented cognitive impairment. We then analyzed the association of cognitive impairment and documentation of cognitive impairment with 6-month mortality or readmission using Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: A total of 282 patients completed the cognitive assessment. Their mean age was 80 years of age, 18.8\% were nonwhite, and 53.2\% were female. Cognitive impairment was present in 132 of 282 patients (46.8\% overall; 25.2\% mild, 21.6\% moderate-severe). Among those with cognitive impairment, 30 of 132 (22.7\%) were documented as such by physicians. Compared with patients whose cognitive impairment was documented by physicians, those whose impairment was not documented were younger (81.3 vs 85.2 years, P{$<$}.05) and had less severe impairment (median Mini-Mental State Examination score 22.0 vs 18.0, P{$<$}.01). After multivariable adjustment, patients whose cognitive impairment was not documented were significantly more likely to experience 6-month mortality or hospital readmission than patients without cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive impairment is common in older adults hospitalized for heart failure, yet it is frequently not documented by physicians. Implementation of strategies to improve recognition and documentation of cognitive impairment may improve the care of these patients, particularly at the time of hospital discharge.},

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 788 recurrent vascular events (ie, myocardial infarction, stroke or vascular death) that were observed during 4.7 (IQR 2.3 to 7.7) years' follow-up. RESULTS: Three Cox proportional hazards models for prediction of 10-year recurrent vascular event risk were developed based on age and sex in addition to clinical parameters (model A), carotid ultrasound findings (model B) or both (model C). Clinical parameters were medical history, current smoking, systolic blood pressure and laboratory biomarkers. In a separate part of the dataset, the concordance statistic of model A was 0.68 (95\% CI 0.64 to 0.71), compared to 0.64 (0.61 to 0.68) for model B and 0.68 (0.65 to 0.72) for model C. Goodness-of-fit and calibration of model A were adequate, also in separate subgroups of patients having coronary, cerebrovascular, peripheral artery or aneurysmal disease. Model A predicted {$<$} 20\% risk in 59\% of patients, 20-30\% risk in 19\% and {$>$} 30\% risk in 23\%. CONCLUSIONS: Patients at high risk for recurrent vascular events can be identified based on readily available clinical characteristics.},

  abstract = {Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is common during ageing and can present as stroke, cognitive decline, neurobehavioural symptoms, or functional impairment. SVD frequently coexists with neurodegenerative disease, and can exacerbate cognitive and other symptoms and affect activities of daily living. Standards for Reporting Vascular Changes on Neuroimaging 1 (STRIVE-1) categorised and standardised the diverse features of SVD that are visible on structural MRI. Since then, new information on these established SVD markers and novel MRI sequences and imaging features have emerged. As the effect of combined SVD imaging features becomes clearer, a key role for quantitative imaging biomarkers to determine sub-visible tissue damage, subtle abnormalities visible at high-field strength MRI, and lesion-symptom patterns, is also apparent. Together with rapidly emerging machine learning methods, these metrics can more comprehensively capture the effect of SVD on the brain than the structural MRI features alone and serve as intermediary outcomes in clinical trials and future routine practice. Using a similar approach to that adopted in STRIVE-1, we updated the guidance on neuroimaging of vascular changes in studies of ageing and neurodegeneration to create STRIVE-2.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are prevalent in the early clinical stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) according to proxy-based instruments. Little is known about which NPS clinicians report and whether their judgment aligns with proxy-based instruments. We used natural language processing (NLP) to classify NPS in electronic health records (EHRs) to estimate the reporting of NPS in symptomatic AD at the memory clinic according to clinicians. Next, we compared NPS as reported in EHRs and NPS reported by caregivers on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI).                                         Methods                                Two academic memory clinic cohorts were used: the Amsterdam UMC (                 n                 \,=\,3001) and the Erasmus MC (                 n                 \,=\,646). Patients included in these cohorts had MCI, AD dementia, or mixed AD/VaD dementia. Ten trained clinicians annotated 13 types of NPS in a randomly selected training set of                 n                 \,=\,500 EHRs from the Amsterdam UMC cohort and in a test set of                 n                 \,=\,250 EHRs from the Erasmus MC cohort. For each NPS, a generalized linear classifier was trained and internally and externally validated. Prevalence estimates of NPS were adjusted for the imperfect sensitivity and specificity of each classifier. Intra-individual comparison of the NPS classified in EHRs and NPS reported on the NPI were conducted in a subsample (59\%).                                                        Results               Internal validation performance of the classifiers was excellent (AUC range: 0.81--0.91), but external validation performance decreased (AUC range: 0.51--0.93). NPS were prevalent in EHRs from the Amsterdam UMC, especially apathy (adjusted prevalence\,=\,69.4\%), anxiety (adjusted prevalence\,=\,53.7\%),~aberrant motor behavior (adjusted prevalence = 47.5\%), irritability (adjusted prevalence = 42.6\%), and depression (adjusted prevalence\,=\,38.5\%). The ranking of NPS was similar for EHRs from the Erasmus MC, although not all classifiers obtained valid prevalence estimates due to low specificity. In both cohorts, there was minimal agreement between NPS classified in the EHRs and NPS reported on the NPI (all kappa coefficients\,{$<$}\,0.28), with substantially more reports of NPS in EHRs than on NPI assessments.                                         Conclusions               NLP classifiers performed well in detecting a wide range of NPS in EHRs of patients with symptomatic AD visiting the memory clinic and showed that clinicians frequently reported NPS in these EHRs. Clinicians generally reported more NPS in EHRs than caregivers reported on the NPI.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are common in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia, but substantial heterogeneity exists in the manifestation of NPS. Sex differences may explain this clinical variability. We aimed to investigate the sex differences in the prevalence and severity of NPS in AD dementia. METHODS: Literature searches were conducted in Embase, MEDLINE/PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar from inception to February 2021. Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment were conducted in duplicate. Effect sizes were calculated as odds ratios (OR) for NPS prevalence and Hedges' g for NPS severity. Data were pooled using random-effects models. Sources of heterogeneity were examined using meta-regression analyses. RESULTS: Sixty-two studies were eligible representing 21,554 patients (61.2\% females). The majority of the included studies had an overall rating of fair quality (71.0\%), with ten studies of good quality (16.1\%) and eight studies of poor quality (12.9\%). There was no sex difference in the presence of any NPS (k = 4, OR = 1.35 [95\% confidence interval 0.78, 2.35]) and overall NPS severity (k = 13, g = 0.04 [-\,0.04, 0.12]). Regarding specific symptoms, female sex was associated with more prevalent depressive symptoms (k = 20, OR = 1.60 [1.28, 1.98]), psychotic symptoms (general psychosis k = 4, OR = 1.62 [1.12, 2.33]; delusions k = 12, OR = 1.56 [1.28, 1.89]), and aberrant motor behavior (k = 6, OR = 1.47 [1.09, 1.98]). In addition, female sex was related to more severe depressive symptoms (k = 16, g = 0.24 [0.14, 0.34]), delusions (k = 10, g = 0.19 [0.04, 0.34]), and aberrant motor behavior (k = 9, g = 0.17 [0.08, 0.26]), while apathy was more severe among males compared to females (k = 11, g = -\,0.10 [-\,0.18, -\,0.01]). There was no association between sex and the prevalence and severity of agitation, anxiety, disinhibition, eating behavior, euphoria, hallucinations, irritability, and sleep disturbances. Meta-regression analyses revealed no consistent association between the effect sizes across studies and method of NPS assessment and demographic and clinical characteristics. DISCUSSION: Female sex was associated with a higher prevalence and greater severity of several specific NPS, while male sex was associated with more severe apathy. While more research is needed into factors underlying these sex differences, our findings may guide tailored treatment approaches of NPS in AD dementia.},

  abstract = {This study aimed at modelling the underlying predictor of ASCVD through the Bayesian network (BN). Data for the AZAR Cohort Study, which evaluated 500 healthcare providers in Iran, was collected through examinations, and blood samples. Two BNs were used to explore a suitable causal model for analysing the underlying predictor of ASCVD; Bayesian search through an algorithmic approach and knowledge-based BNs. Results showed significant differences in ASCVD risk factors across background variables' levels. The diagnostic indices showed better performance for the knowledge-based BN (Area under ROC curve (AUC)\,=\,0.78, Accuracy\,=\,76.6, Sensitivity\,=\,62.5, Negative predictive value (NPV)\,=\,96.0, Negative Likelihood Ratio (LR-)\,=\,0.48) compared to Bayesian search (AUC\,=\,0.76, Accuracy\,=\,72.4, Sensitivity\,=\,17.5, NPV\,=\,93.2, LR-\,=\,0.83). In addition, we decided on knowledge-based BN because of the interpretability of the relationships. Based on this BN, being male (conditional probability\,=\,63.7), age over 45 (36.3), overweight (51.5), Mets (23.8), diabetes (8.3), smoking (10.6), hypertension (12.1), high T-C (28.5), high LDL-C (23.9), FBS (12.1), and TG (25.9) levels were associated with higher ASCVD risk. Low and normal HDL-C levels also had higher ASCVD risk (35.3 and 37.4), while high HDL-C levels had lower risk (27.3). In conclusion, BN demonstrated that ASCVD was significantly associated with certain risk factors including being older and overweight male, having a history of Mets, diabetes, hypertension, having high levels of T-C, LDL-C, FBS, and TG, but Low and normal HDL-C and being a smoker. The study may provide valuable insights for developing effective prevention strategies for ASCVD in Iran.},

  abstract = {Summary             Platelet activation and aggregation are critical in the pathogenesis of acute ischemic cerebrovascular diseases. The aim of our study was to characterize platelet function in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), and to evaluate the effect of platelet activation on clinical outcome. One hundred thirty-eight consecutive patients with TIA (n=74) or stroke (n=64) were enrolled in this study. Platelet aggregation in response to ADP, epinephrine, arachidonic acid, or collagen, and expression of platelet activation receptors (CD62P, CD63, LIBS-1 and PAC-1) in the acute phase and at three months follow-up were evaluated. Platelets derived from stroke patients were more hyperaggregable in response to agonists in the acute phase compared to TIA patients (p[ADP]=0.002, p[arachidonic acid]=0.047, p[epinephrine]=0.020). Platelet activation was enhanced in the acute phase irrespective of the severity of the disease (stroke or TIA) and returned to baseline levels three months later. Persistent elevated platelet activation at three months follow-up (PAC-1) was associated with increased incidence of recurrent stroke (median, [interquartile range] 3.4, [3.0--5.2] versus 2.9, [2.3--4.0], p=0.048). In conclusion, platelets are hyperactive in acute stroke compared with TIA. A more intensified dual antiplatelet therapy may be of benefit for stroke patients.},

As normal values for these markers are unknown, our objective was to obtain reference values in the general population. We obtained data from a population-based prospective cohort study of individuals aged 45 years and over between 2002 and 2014. Absolute blood counts were used to calculate the NLR, PLR and SII. All inflammatory indices followed a log-normal distribution. We calculated the mean and 95\% reference intervals in an unselected population. Furthermore we studied whether the inflammatory markers differed between age categories and gender. In total 8,711 participants (57.1\% female; mean age 65.9 years, standard deviation 10.5 years) were included. Mean values and corresponding 95\% reference intervals for the NLR were: 1.76 (0.83--3.92), for PLR: 120 (61--239) and for SII: 459 (189--1168). The inflammatory markers increased with age. The PLR and SII were higher in females, whilst the NLR was higher in males. In conclusion, we provided reference values for new inflammatory markers. All increase with age and vary with gender. This provides context that allows for proper interpretation of their potential value in future clinical practice and research.},

  abstract = {Background               Sex disparities in acute ischemic stroke outcomes are well reported with IV thrombolysis. Despite several studies, there is still a lack of consensus on whether endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) outcomes differ between men and women.                                         Objective               To compare sex differences in EVT outcomes at 90-day follow-up and assess whether progression in functional status from discharge to 90-day follow-up differs between men and women.                                         Methods               From the Selection for Endovascular Treatment in Acute Ischemic Stroke (SELECT) prospective cohort study (2016--2018), adult men and women ({$\geq$}18\,years) with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion (internal carotid artery, middle cerebral artery M1/M2) treated with EVT up to 24 hours from last known well were matched using propensity scores. Discharge and 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores were compared between men and women. Furthermore, we evaluated the improvement in mRS scores from discharge to 90 days in men and women using a repeated-measures, mixed-effects regression model.                                         Results               Of 285 patients, 139 (48.8\%) were women. Women were older with median (IQR) age 69 (57--81) years vs 64.5 (56--75), p=0.044, had smaller median perfusion deficits (Tmax {$>$}6\,s) 109 vs 154\,mL (p{$<$}0.001), and had better collaterals on CT angiography and CT perfusion but similar ischemic core size (relative cerebral blood flow {$<$}30\%: 7.6 (0--25.2) vs 11.4 (0--38)\,mL, p=0.22). In 65 propensity-matched pairs, despite similar discharge functional independence rates (women: 42\% vs men: 48\%, aOR=0.55, 95\% CI 0.18 to 1.69, p=0.30), women exhibited worse 90-day functional independence rates (women: 46\% vs men: 60\%, aOR=0.41, 95\% CI 0.16 to 1.00, p=0.05). The reduction in mRS scores from discharge to 90 days also demonstrated a significantly larger improvement in men (discharge 2.49 and 90 days 1.88, improvement 0.61) than in women (discharge 2.52 and 90 days 2.44, improvement 0.08, p=0.036).                                         Conclusion               In a propensity-matched cohort from the SELECT study, women had similar discharge outcomes as men following EVT, but the improvement from discharge to 90 days was significantly worse in women, suggesting the influence of post-discharge factors. Further exploration of this phenomenon to identify target interventions is warranted.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In cardiovascular disease, prevention strategies targeting standard modifiable cardiovascular risk factors (SMuRFs; hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia, and smoking) are crucial; however, myocardial infarction in the absence of SMuRFs is not infrequent. The outcomes of individuals without SMuRFs are not well known. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed adult patients with first-presentation ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) using data from the Swedish myocardial infarction registry SWEDEHEART. Clinical characteristics and outcomes of adult patients (age {$\geq$}18 years) with and without SMuRFs were examined overall and by sex. Patients with a known history of coronary artery disease were excluded. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 30 days after STEMI presentation. Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular mortality, heart failure, and myocardial infarction at30 days. Endpoints were also examined up to discharge, and to the end of a 12-year follow-up. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to compare in-hospital mortality, and Cox-proportional hazard models and Kaplan-Meier analysis for long-term outcomes. FINDINGS: Between Jan 1, 2005, and May 25, 2018, 9228 (14{$\cdot$}9\%) of 62\,048 patients with STEMI had no SMuRFs reaching diagnostic thresholds. Median age was similar between patients with SMuRFs and patients without SMuRFs (68 years [IQR 59-78]) vs 69 years [60-78], p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001). SMuRF-less patients had a similar rate of percutaneous coronary intervention to those with at least one modifiable risk factor, but were significantly less likely to receive statins, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockade (ARB), or {$\beta$}-blockers at discharge. By 30 days after presentation, all-cause mortality was significantly higher in SMuRF-less patients (hazard ratio 1{$\cdot$}47 [95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}37-1{$\cdot$}57], p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001). SMuRF-less women had the highest 30-day mortality (381 [17{$\cdot$}6\%] of 2164), followed by women with SMuRFs (2032 [11{$\cdot$}1\%] of 18\,220), SMuRF-less men (660 [9{$\cdot$}3\%] of 7064), and men with SMuRFs (2117 [6{$\cdot$}1\%] of 34\,600). The increased risk of 30-day all-cause mortality in SMuRF-less patients remained significant after adjusting for age, sex, left ventricular ejection fraction, creatinine, and blood pressure, but was attenuated on inclusion of pharmacotherapy prescription (ACEI or ARB, {$\beta$}-blocker, or statin) at discharge. Additionally, SMuRF-less patients had a significantly higher rate of in-hospital all-cause mortality than patients with one or more SMuRF (883 [9{$\cdot$}6\%] vs 3411 [6{$\cdot$}5\%], p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001). Myocardial infarction and heart failure at 30 days were lower in SMuRF-less patients. All-cause mortality remained increased in the SMuRF-less group for more than 8 years in men and up to the 12-year endpoint in women. INTERPRETATION: Individuals who present with STEMI in the absence of SMuRFs have a significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality, compared with those with at least one SMuRF, which was particularly evident in women. The increased early mortality rates are attenuated after adjustment for use of guideline-indicated treatments, highlighting the need for evidence-based pharmacotherapy during the immediate post-infarct period irrespective of perceived low risk.

The role of hypertension, cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, and smoking in driving disease has been well recognized at a population level and has been the target of primary prevention strategies for over 50 years with substantial impact. However, in many cases, these factors alone do not provide enough precision at the individual level to allow physicians and patients to take appropriate preventive measures and many patients continue to suffer acute coronary syndromes in the absence of these risk factors. Recent advances in user-friendly chip designs, high speed throughput, and economic efficiency of genome-wide association studies complemented by advances in statistical analytical approaches have facilitated the rapid development of polygenic risk scores (PRSs). The latest PRSs combine data regarding hundreds of thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphisms to predict chronic diseases including CAD. Novel CAD PRSs are strong predictors of risk and may have application, in a complementary manner with existing risk prediction algorithms. However, there remain substantial controversies, and ultimately, we need to move forward from observational studies to prospectively and rigorously assess the potential impact if widespread implementation is to be aspired to. Consideration needs to be made of ethnicity, sex, as well as age, and risk estimate based on existing non-genomic algorithms. We provide an overview and commentary on the important advances in deriving and validating PRSs, as well as pragmatic considerations that will be required for implementation of the new knowledge into clinical practice.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: We included patients enrolled in the Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain (PROMISE) trial and randomized to CTA. Exclusively level III-certified readers, blinded to demographic and clinical data, assessed the prevalence of CAD\,{$\geq$}\,50\% in a central core lab. After comparing the recent European Society of Cardiology-Diamond and Forrester PTP (ESC-DF) with the actual observed prevalence of CAD\,{$\geq$}\,50\%, we created a new PTP set by replacing the ESC-DF PTP with the observed prevalence of CAD\,{$\geq$}\,50\% across strata of age, sex, and type of angina. In 4415 patients (48.3\% men; 60.5\,{\textpm}\,8.2\,years; 78\% atypical angina; 11\% typical angina; 11\% non-anginal chest pain), the observed prevalence of CAD\,{$\geq$}\,50\% was 13.9\%, only one-third of the average ESC-DF PTP (40.6; P\,{$<$}\,0.001 for difference). The PTP in the new set ranged 2-48\% and were consistently lower than the ESC-DF PTP across all age, sex, and angina type categories. Initially, 4284/4415 (97\%) patients were classified as intermediate-probability by the ESC-DF (PTP 15-85\%); using the PROMISE-PTP, 50.2\% of these patients were reclassified to the low PTP category (PTP\,{$<$}\,15\%). CONCLUSION: The ESC-DF PTP overestimate vastly the actual prevalence of CAD\,{$\geq$}\,50\%. A new set of PTP, derived from results of non-invasive testing, may substantially reduce the need for non-invasive tests in stable chest pain.},

Such ``exemplars'' can be found by randomly choosing an initial subset of data points and then iteratively refining it, but this works well only if that initial choice is close to a good solution. We devised a method called ``affinity propagation,'' which takes as input measures of similarity between pairs of data points. Real-valued messages are exchanged between data points until a high-quality set of exemplars and corresponding clusters gradually emerges. We used affinity propagation to cluster images of faces, detect genes in microarray data, identify representative sentences in this manuscript, and identify cities that are efficiently accessed by airline travel. Affinity propagation found clusters with much lower error than other methods, and it did so in less than one-hundredth the amount of time.},

Microbes are immobilized in NETs and encounter a locally high and lethal concentration of effector proteins. Recent studies show that NETs are formed inside the vasculature in infections and noninfectious diseases. Here we report that NETs provide a heretofore unrecognized scaffold and stimulus for thrombus formation. NETs perfused with blood caused platelet adhesion, activation, and aggregation. DNase or the anticoagulant heparin dismantled the NET scaffold and prevented thrombus formation. Stimulation of platelets with purified histones was sufficient for aggregation. NETs recruited red blood cells, promoted fibrin deposition, and induced a red thrombus, such as that found in veins. Markers of extracellular DNA traps were detected in a thrombus and plasma of baboons subjected to deep vein thrombosis, an example of inflammation-enhanced thrombosis. Our observations indicate that NETs are a previously unrecognized link between inflammation and thrombosis and may further explain the epidemiological association of infection with thrombosis.},

Patients with chronic granulomatous disease carry mutations in NADPH oxidase and cannot activate this cell-death pathway or make NETs.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review and highlight the unappreciated roles of eosinophils suggested by recent studies. DATA SOURCES: The literature, unpublished observations, and insights by the authors. STUDY SELECTIONS: Basic studies of mouse models and patient-based clinical studies of disease. RESULTS: Eosinophils are often thought of as destructive end-stage effector cells primarily linked to parasite host defense and dysregulated immune responses associated with allergic diseases, such as asthma. However, recent studies (ie, research focused on mechanisms of action and translational studies examining disease/inflammatory pathways) are suggesting far more complex roles for eosinophils. The goal of this review is 3-fold. (1) The authors examine the dynamic history of eosinophils and how physicians over time used this information to formulate defining hypotheses. Particular emphasis is placed on recent studies challenging the parochial view of host defense in favor of roles maintaining homeostasis through immune modulation and tissue remodeling/repair. (2) They discuss diagnostic approaches to assess eosinophils in clinical settings as a means of disease identification and subsequently as a measurement of disease severity. (3) They examine how contemporary views of eosinophils and their perceived roles in diseases have led to specific therapeutic strategies. The emphasis is to review the successes and failures of these strategies as the basis of formulating future clinical studies targeting eosinophils as potential therapies of disease. CONCLUSION: Despite the complexities of eosinophil-mediated activities and the less than overwhelming success of initial attempts targeting these cells, eosinophils remain a potentially important focal target of disease diagnosis and subsequent treatment strategies.},

  abstract = {Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease of the wall of large- and medium-sized arteries that is precipitated by elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the blood. Although dendritic cells (DCs) and lymphocytes are found in the adventitia of normal arteries, their number is greatly expanded and their distribution changed in human and mouse atherosclerotic arteries. Macrophages, DCs, foam cells, lymphocytes, and other inflammatory cells are found in the intimal atherosclerotic lesions. Beneath these lesions, adventitial leukocytes organize in clusters that resemble tertiary lymphoid tissues. Experimental interventions can reduce the number of available blood monocytes, from which macrophages and most DCs and foam cells are derived, and reduce atherosclerotic lesion burden without altering blood lipids. Under proatherogenic conditions, nitric oxide production from endothelial cells is reduced and the burden of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and advanced glycation end products (AGE) is increased. Incapacitating ROS-generating NADPH oxidase or the receptor for AGE (RAGE) has beneficial effects. Targeting inflammatory adhesion molecules also reduces atherosclerosis. Conversely, removing or blocking IL-10 or TGF-{$\beta$} accelerates atherosclerosis. Regulatory T cells and B1 cells secreting natural antibodies are atheroprotective. This review summarizes our current understanding of inflammatory and immune mechanisms in atherosclerosis.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose---                              We sought to investigate the association between carotid intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH) and ipsilateral symptoms of cerebral ischemia.                                                          Methods---                              A search was performed for clinical observational studies comparing the incidence of IPH between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Odds ratios (ORs) for IPH as a factor in the pathogenesis of neurologic events were calculated and combined by a meta-analysis. Interstudy heterogeneity, estimated effects, and methodologic quality of the studies were assessed.                                                          Results---                              Thirty-one studies were included for analysis. The reported ORs varied widely. Overall, the incidence of IPH in the symptomatic groups was significantly higher than in the asymptomatic group. However, there was an apparent trend for heterogeneity (               P               {$<$}0.00001) between studies. The random-effects summary estimator of ORs was 2.25 (95\% CI, 1.57 to 3.22;               P               {$<$}0.00001). To identify potential sources of heterogeneity, subgroup analyses were performed. The pooled ORs varied greatly by stratification. Major heterogeneity was found among studies with low quality, microscopic methods of examination, significant effects, small sizes, early publication, and unequal severity of carotid stenosis in both groups. Large, recent, macroscopic, or high-quality studies, as well as studies with equal degrees of stenosis, tended to yield insignificant associations. The methods in defining and evaluating hemorrhage were very heterogeneous. Characterizations of the age, size, number, and location of hemorrhages were poorly reported and highly variable. In addition, a lack of control of confounders and selection bias were frequently identified among studies.                                                          Conclusions---                              Statistical inferences have suggested a plausible role in the production of cerebral ischemia; however, reliable interpretation was strongly undermined by poor methodologic quality, substantial heterogeneity, and suspicious publication bias. To preciously estimate the underlying correlation, a well-designed study with uniformity in definition and evaluation for IPH might be warranted.},

  abstract = {Platelet activation is a link in the pathophysiology of diseases prone to thrombosis and inflammation. Numerous platelet markers, including mean platelet volume (MPV), have been investigated in connection with both thrombosis and inflammation. This review considers MPV as a prognostic and therapeutic marker as well as the factors influencing its measurement. Established cardiovascular risk factors, such as smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes, can influence MPV, depending on confounding factors. Low-grade inflammation is one such factor. Evidence, particularly derived from prospective studies and a meta-analysis, suggest a correlation between an increase in MPV and the risk of thrombosis. High MPV associates with a variety of established risk factors, cardio- and cerebrovascular disorders, and low-grade inflammatory conditions prone to arterial and venous thromboses. High-grade inflammatory diseases, such as active rheumatoid arthritis or attacks of familial Mediterranean fever, present with low levels of MPV, which reverse in the course of anti-inflammatory therapy. Lifestyle modification, antihypertensive, lipid lowering and diet therapies can also affect MPV values, but these effects need to be investigated in large prospective studies with thrombotic endpoints.},

Brain segmentation was used to quantify volumes of brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid, and white matter lesions. Infarcts were rated visually. Brain volume, ventricular volume, and gray matter volume were divided by intracranial volume to obtain indicators of brain atrophy. Neuropsychological tests assessing executive functioning and memory were performed, and scores were transformed into z scores. The authors used linear regression analyses, adjusted for age, sex, education, intelligence, and vascular risk factors, to investigate the association of white matter lesions and number of lacunar infarcts with cognitive performance. A 1-standard-deviation higher volume of white matter lesions (beta = -0.12, 95\% confidence interval: -0.20, -0.04) and the presence of {$>$}or=2 lacunar infarcts (beta = -0.48, 95\% confidence interval: -0.87, -0.09) were associated with worse executive functioning. These associations remained after adjusting for brain atrophy. Both were not associated with worse memory. Results suggest that subcortical ischemic vascular lesions are associated with decreased executive functioning, but not with memory functioning, independent of brain atrophy.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate brain volumes, white matter lesion (WML) volume and asymptomatic infarcts on MRI in a large cohort of patients with atherosclerotic disease. METHODS: Within the SMART-MR (Second Manifestations of ARTerial disease-Magnetic Resonance) study, a prospective cohort study on determinants and course of brain changes on MRI, cross-sectional analyses were performed in 1044 patients (mean age 58+/-10 years, 80\% male) with coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, or abdominal aortic aneurysm. Brain segmentation was used to quantify volumes of cortical gray matter, white matter, sulcal and ventricular cerebrospinal fluid, and WML. All volumes were expressed relative to intracranial volume. Brain infarcts were rated visually and distinctions were made between cortical infarcts, large subcortical infarcts, lacunar infarcts, and infarcts in the cerebellum and brainstem. RESULTS: With older age a nonlinear (quadratic) decrease in total brain volume was observed and a nonlinear increase in ventricular volume and WML. Cortical gray matter volume showed a linear decrease with age and was stronger in men than in women. WML volumes also increased more strongly in men than in women, while ventricular volume decrease showed no sex difference. Silent brain infarcts were present in 14\% of men and women, and increased to 24\% of subjects aged 65 years or older. CONCLUSION: In a population with atherosclerotic diseases, decrease in brain volumes with increasing age is comparable with findings from the general population. However, vascular pathology on MRI, as indicated by white matter lesions and silent brain infarcts may be more common.},

  abstract = {AIMS: The aim was to validate, update, and extend the Diamond-Forrester model for estimating the probability of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) in a contemporary cohort. METHODS AND RESULTS: Prospectively collected data from 14 hospitals on patients with chest pain without a history of CAD and referred for conventional coronary angiography (CCA) were used. Primary outcome was obstructive CAD, defined as {$\geq$} 50\% stenosis in one or more vessels on CCA. The validity of the Diamond-Forrester model was assessed using calibration plots, calibration-in-the-large, and recalibration in logistic regression. The model was subsequently updated and extended by revising the predictive value of age, sex, and type of chest pain. Diagnostic performance was assessed by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (c-statistic) and reclassification was determined. We included 2260 patients, of whom 1319 had obstructive CAD on CCA. Validation demonstrated an overestimation of the CAD probability, especially in women. The updated and extended models demonstrated a c-statistic of 0.79 (95\% CI 0.77-0.81) and 0.82 (95\% CI 0.80-0.84), respectively. Sixteen per cent of men and 64\% of women were correctly reclassified. The predicted probability of obstructive CAD ranged from 10\% for 50-year-old females with non-specific chest pain to 91\% for 80-year-old males with typical chest pain. Predictions varied across hospitals due to differences in disease prevalence. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the Diamond-Forrester model overestimates the probability of CAD especially in women. We updated the predictive effects of age, sex, type of chest pain, and hospital setting which improved model performance and we extended it to include patients of 70 years and older.},

However, growing evidence suggests that TICI 3 is the best angiographic predictor of improved functional outcomes. To assess the association between successful TICI revascularization grades and functional independence at 90 days, we performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis of thrombectomy studies that reported TICI scores and functional outcomes, measured by the modified Rankin Scale, using the semi-automated AutoLit software platform. Forty studies with 8691 patients were included in the quantitative synthesis. Across TICI, modified TICI (mTICI), and expanded TICI (eTICI), the highest rate of good functional outcomes was observed in patients with TICI 3 recanalization, followed by those with TICI 2c and TICI 2b recanalization, respectively. Rates of good functional outcomes were similar among patients with either TICI 2c or TICI 3 grades. On further sensitivity analysis of the eTICI scale, the rates of good functional outcomes were equivalent between eTICI 2b50 and eTICI 2b67 (OR 0.81, 95\% CI 0.52\,to 1.25). We conclude that near complete or complete revascularization (TICI 2c/3) is associated with higher rates of functional outcomes after EVT.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammation and leukocyte infiltration are hallmarks of atherosclerosis. Clinically routine hematology analyzers mostly perform an entire differential blood count by default, irrespective of the requested parameter. We hypothesize that these normally unreported leukocyte characteristics associate with coronary artery disease (CAD) severity and can improve prediction of mortality in coronary angiography patients. METHODS: We studied coronary angiography patients suspected of CAD (n\,=\,1015) from the Utrecht Coronary Biobank cohort. Leukocyte characteristics were routinely assessed in blood drawn directly prior to angiography using an automated hematology analyzer and extracted from the Utrecht patient oriented database (UPOD) database. Patients were followed up for a median duration of 805 days, during which 65 patients died. We evaluated the association of leukocyte characteristics with synergy between PCI with taxus and cardiac surgery (SYNTAX) score as a measure of CAD severity, all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). In order to determine the improvement of risk prediction, we calculated continuous net reclassification improvement (cNRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). RESULTS: Monocyte percentage showed strong independent predictive value for all-cause mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 1.44 (1.19-1.74), p\,{$<$}\,0.001), and the monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio performed best for cardiovascular mortality (HR 1.42 (1.11-1.81), p\,=\,0.005). The cNRIs and IDIs of leukocyte characteristics for all-cause mortality confirmed the improvement in mortality risk prediction. No significantly predictive leukocyte characteristics were found for MACEs. CONCLUSION: Readily available yet unreported leukocyte characteristics from routine hematology analyzers significantly improved prediction of mortality in coronary angiography patients on top of clinical characteristics.},

  abstract = {Networks constructed from aggregated protein-protein interaction data are commonplace in biology. But the studies these data are derived from were conducted with their own hypotheses and foci. Focusing on data from budding yeast present in BioGRID, we determine that many of the downstream signals present in network data are significantly impacted by biases in the original data. We determine the degree to which selection bias in favor of biologically interesting bait proteins goes down with study size, while we also find that promiscuity in prey contributes more substantially in larger studies. We analyze interaction studies over time with respect to data in the Gene Ontology and find that reproducibly observed interactions are less likely to favor multifunctional proteins. We find that strong alignment between co-expression and protein-protein interaction data occurs only for extreme co-expression values, and use this data to suggest candidates for targets likely to reveal novel biology in follow-up studies. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Protein-protein interaction data finds particularly heavy use in the interpretation of disease-causal variants. In principle, network data allows researchers to find novel commonalities among candidate genes. In this study, we detail several of the most salient biases contributing to aggregated protein-protein interaction databases. We find strong evidence for the role of selection and laboratory biases. Many of these effects contribute to the commonalities researchers find for disease genes. In order for characterization of disease genes and their interactions to not simply be an artifact of researcher preference, it is imperative to identify data biases explicitly. Based on this, we also suggest ways to move forward in producing candidates less influenced by prior knowledge.

  abstract = {Objective:Longitudinal studies of dementia rely on the assumption that individuals who drop out are comparable to those who remain in the study, adjusting for measured covariates. Existing methods to handle dropouts account for differences based on past health and cognitive measures. We assess whether such adjustments fully account for differences in future dementia risk.Methods:Among Three-City Study participants in Dijon, France, with 1 (n = 1,633) or 2 (n = 1,168) brain MRI scans, we tested whether white matter lesion volume (WMLV), hippocampal volume, or brain CSF volume predicted dropout (``unable to contact'' or ``refused interview'') in repeated-measures logistic regression with up to 4 follow-ups (average 3.5 waves). Using linear regression, we also estimated differences in MRI volumes and MRI changes by subsequent dropout status and estimated plausible ranges for selective attrition bias based on these associations. Models were adjusted for demographic, health, and cognitive score covariates.Results:Baseline greater WMLV predicted increased odds of dropping out (adjusted odds ratio = 1.71; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.20-2.43). Among participants with 2 MRI scans, individuals who subsequently dropped out had significantly worse declines in hippocampal volume (-0.30 SD difference; 95\% CI -0.43 to -0.17) between the first and second MRI scans.Conclusions:Higher future dementia risk, indicated by worse past brain MRI findings, predicted future study dropout. Adjustment for selective attrition, based on MRI markers when available, may help reduce bias in estimates of dementia incidence and improve research on dementia risk factors. MRI findings may also help prospectively identify cohort members at elevated risk of attrition.},

This statement serves as an overall guide for practitioners to gain a better understanding of VCI and dementia, prevention, and treatment.

The writing group used systematic literature reviews (primarily covering publications from 1990 to May 1, 2010), previously published guidelines, personal files, and expert opinion to summarize existing evidence, indicate gaps in current knowledge, and, when appropriate, formulate recommendations using standard American Heart Association criteria. All members of the writing group had the opportunity to comment on the recommendations and approved the final version of this document. After peer review by the American Heart Association, as well as review by the Stroke Council leadership, Council on Epidemiology and Prevention Council, and Scientific Statements Oversight Committee, the statement was approved by the American Heart Association Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee.                                         Results---               The construct of VCI has been introduced to capture the entire spectrum of cognitive disorders associated with all forms of cerebral vascular brain injury---not solely stroke---ranging from mild cognitive impairment through fully developed dementia. Dysfunction of the neurovascular unit and mechanisms regulating cerebral blood flow are likely to be important components of the pathophysiological processes underlying VCI. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is emerging as an important marker of risk for Alzheimer disease, microinfarction, microhemorrhage and macrohemorrhage of the brain, and VCI. The neuropathology of cognitive impairment in later life is often a mixture of Alzheimer disease and microvascular brain damage, which may overlap and synergize to heighten the risk of cognitive impairment. In this regard, magnetic resonance imaging and other neuroimaging techniques play an important role in the definition and detection of VCI and provide evidence that subcortical forms of VCI with white matter hyperintensities and small deep infarcts are common. In many cases, risk markers for VCI are the same as traditional risk factors for stroke. These risks may include but are not limited to atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia. Furthermore, these same vascular risk factors may be risk markers for Alzheimer disease. Carotid intimal-medial thickness and arterial stiffness are emerging as markers of arterial aging and may serve as risk markers for VCI. Currently, no specific treatments for VCI have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. However, detection and control of the traditional risk factors for stroke and cardiovascular disease may be effective in the prevention of VCI, even in older people.                                         Conclusions---               Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia are important. Understanding of VCI has evolved substantially in recent years, based on preclinical, neuropathologic, neuroimaging, physiological, and epidemiological studies. Transdisciplinary, translational, and transactional approaches are recommended to further our understanding of this entity and to better characterize its neuropsychological profile. There is a need for prospective, quantitative, clinical-pathological-neuroimaging studies to improve knowledge of the pathological basis of neuroimaging change and the complex interplay between vascular and Alzheimer disease pathologies in the evolution of clinical VCI and Alzheimer disease. Long-term vascular risk marker interventional studies beginning as early as midlife may be required to prevent or postpone the onset of VCI and Alzheimer disease. Studies of intensive reduction of vascular risk factors in high-risk groups are another important avenue of research.},

After peer review by the American Heart Association, as well as review by the Stroke Council leadership, Council on Epidemiology and Prevention Council, and Scientific Statements Oversight Committee, the statement was approved by the American Heart Association Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee.Results---The construct of VCI has been introduced to capture the entire spectrum of cognitive disorders associated with all forms of cerebral vascular brain injury---not solely stroke---ranging from mild cognitive impairment through fully developed dementia. Dysfunction of the neurovascular unit and mechanisms regulating cerebral blood flow are likely to be important components of the pathophysiological processes underlying VCI. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is emerging as an important marker of risk for Alzheimer disease, microinfarction, microhemorrhage and macrohemorrhage of the brain, and VCI. The neuropathology of cognitive impairment in later life is often a mixture of Alzheimer disease and microvascular brain damage, which may overlap and synergize to heighten the risk of cognitive impairment. In this regard, magnetic resonance imaging and other neuroimaging techniques play an important role in the definition and detection of VCI and provide evidence that subcortical forms of VCI with white matter hyperintensities and small deep infarcts are common. In many cases, risk markers for VCI are the same as traditional risk factors for stroke. These risks may include but are not limited to atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia. Furthermore, these same vascular risk factors may be risk markers for Alzheimer disease. Carotid intimal-medial thickness and arterial stiffness are emerging as markers of arterial aging and may serve as risk markers for VCI. Currently, no specific treatments for VCI have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. However, detection and control of the traditional risk factors for stroke and cardiovascular disease may be effective in the prevention of VCI, even in older people.Conclusions---Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia are important. Understanding of VCI has evolved substantially in recent years, based on preclinical, neuropathologic, neuroimaging, physiological, and epidemiological studies. Transdisciplinary, translational, and transactional approaches are recommended to further our understanding of this entity and to better characterize its neuropsychological profile. There is a need for prospective, quantitative, clinical-pathological-neuroimaging studies to improve knowledge of the pathological basis of neuroimaging change and the complex interplay between vascular and Alzheimer disease pathologies in the evolution of clinical VCI and Alzheimer disease. Long-term vascular risk marker interventional studies beginning as early as midlife may be required to prevent or postpone the onset of VCI and Alzheimer disease. Studies of intensive reduction of vascular risk factors in high-risk groups are another important avenue of research.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Inflammatory markers predict first-time ischemic events. We investigated whether leukocyte and differential counts predict recurrent events and ischemic events in high-risk populations, and whether such events are preceded by acutely exacerbated inflammation. METHODS: We studied 18 558 patients with ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or peripheral arterial disease who participated in the trial of Clopidogrel versus Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischemic Events (CAPRIE), a study that compared the occurrence of ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death under randomized treatment with aspirin or clopidogrel. Leukocyte counts were frequently assessed during followup. RESULTS: Compared with the quartile with lowest leukocyte counts at baseline ({$<$}5.9x10(9)/L), patients in the top quartile ({$>$}8.2x10(9)/L) had higher risks for ischemic stroke (relative risk 1.30; P=0.007), myocardial infarction (relative risk 1.56, P{$<$}0.001), and vascular death (relative risk 1.51; P{$<$}0.001) after adjustment for other risk factors. Neutrophil counts contributed most to increased risk. Assessments of regression dilution effects based on replicate measurements show that these risk associations may underestimate the real associations by 30 to 50\%. Treatment with aspirin or clopidogrel did not influence predictive effects by leukocytes. In the week before a recurrent event, but not at earlier time points, the leukocyte count was significantly increased over baseline levels (n=211; mean difference +0.46x10(9)/L; P=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Leukocyte counts and mainly neutrophil counts are independently associated with ischemic events in these high-risk populations. An increase of leukocyte counts over baseline levels heralds a period of increased risk lasting about one week.},

The quality of these evaluations depends on the quality and completeness of the input data. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We assessed the performance of an electronic health record (EHR)-based data mining algorithm, using the example of the smoking status in a cardiovascular population. As a reference standard, we used the questionnaire from the Utrecht Cardiovascular Cohort (UCC). To assess diagnostic accuracy, we calculated sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV). RESULTS: We analyzed 1,661 patients included in the UCC to January 18, 2019. Of those, 14\% (n~=~238) had missing information on smoking status in the UCC questionnaire. Data mining provided information on smoking status in 99\% of the 1,661 participants. Diagnostic accuracy for current smoking was sensitivity 88\%, specificity 92\%, NPV 98\%, and PPV 63\%. From false positives, 85\% reported they had quit smoking at the time of the UCC. CONCLUSION: Data mining showed great potential in retrieving information on smoking (a near complete yield). Its diagnostic performance is good for negative smoking statuses. The implications of misclassification with data mining are dependent on the application of the data.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Chest pain or discomfort affects 20\%-40\% of the general population over the course of their life and may be a symptom of myocardial ischaemia. For the diagnosis of obstructive macrovascular coronary artery disease (CAD), algorithms have been developed; however, these do not exclude microvascular angina. This may lead to false reassurance of symptomatic patients, mainly women, with functionally significant, yet non-obstructive coronary vascular disease. Therefore, this study aims to estimate the prevalence of both macrovascular and microvascular coronary vascular disease in women and men presenting with chest pain or discomfort, and to subsequently develop a decision-support tool to aid cardiologists in referral to cardiovascular imaging for both macrovascular and microvascular CAD evaluation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Women and men with chest pain or discomfort, aged 45 years and older, without a history of cardiovascular disease, who are referred to an outpatient cardiology clinic by their general practitioner are eligible for inclusion. Coronary CT angiography is used for anatomical imaging. Additionally, myocardial perfusion imaging by adenosine stress cardiac MRI is performed to detect functionally significant coronary vascular disease. Electronic health record data, collected during regular cardiac work-up, including medical history, cardiovascular risk factors, physical examination, echocardiography, (exercise) ECG and blood samples for standard cardiovascular biomarkers and research purposes, are obtained. Participants will be classified as positive or negative for coronary vascular disease based on all available data by expert panel consensus (a cardiovascular radiologist and two cardiologists). After completion of the clinical study, all collected data will be used to develop a decision support tool using predictive modelling and machine-learning techniques. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University Medical Center Utrecht. Results will be disseminated through national and international conferences and in peer-reviewed journals in cardiovascular disease. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Trialregister.nl Registry NL8702.},

  abstract = {Cerebral myelin maturation and aging-related degradation constitute fundamental features of human brain integrity and functioning. Although mostly studied in the white matter, the cerebral cortex contains significant amounts of myelinated axons. However, how intracortical myelin content evolves during development, decays in aging, and links with cognition remain poorly understood. Several studies have shown the potential of mapping myelin in the cortex by use of T1-weighted (T1w) and T2-weighted (T2w) magnetic resonance imaging signal intensity, which show inverse sensitivity to myelin. Here, we characterized cortical myelin in 339 participants 8--83 years of age using a recently introduced T1w/T2w ratio myelin mapping technique and mean diffusivity (MD) from diffusion tensor imaging. To test for cognitive correlates, we used intraindividual variability (IIV) in performance during a speeded task, a measure recently associated with white matter integrity. The results showed that intracortical myelin maturation was ongoing until the late 30s, followed by 20 relative stable years before declining from the late 50s. For MD, U-shaped paths showing similar patterns were observed, but with fewer maturational effects in some regions. IIV was correlated with both T1w/T2w ratio and MD, mainly indicating that the higher degree of intracortical myelin is associated with greater performance stability. The relations were more prominent with advancing age, suggesting that aging-related cortical demyelination contributes to increased IIV. The T1w/T2w ratio myelin-mapping technique thus seems sensitive to intracortical myelin content in normal development and aging, relates to cognitive functioning, and might constitute an important future tool in mapping normal and clinical brain changes.},

  abstract = {Background               Agitation is a common neuropsychiatric symptom of Alzheimer disease (AD). Data are scarce regarding agitation prevalence among community-dwelling patients with AD.                                         Objective               To estimate agitation prevalence in a sample of US patients with AD/dementia overall and by AD/dementia disease severity, using data from electronic health records (EHR).                                         Methods               This retrospective database study examined community-dwelling patients with {$\geq$}1 EHR record indicating AD/dementia from January 2008 to June 2015 and no evidence of non-Alzheimer dementia during the 12-month preindex and postindex periods. Agitation was identified using diagnosis codes for dementia with behavioral disturbance and EHR abstracted notes records indicating agitation symptoms compiled from the International Psychogeriatric Association provisional consensus definition.                                         Results               Of 320~886 eligible patients (mean age, 76.4~y, 64.7\% female), 143~160 (44.6\%) had evidence of agitation during the observation period. Less than 5\% of patients with agitation had a diagnosis code for behavioral disturbance. The most prevalent symptom categories among patients with agitation, preindex and postindex, were agitation (31.4\% and 41.3\%), falling (22.6\% and 21.7\%), and restlessness (18.3\% and 23.3\%). Among the 78~827 patients (24.6\%) with known AD/dementia severity, agitation prevalence was 61.3\%. Agitation during the observation period was most prevalent for moderate-to-severe and severe AD/dementia (74.6\% and 68.3\%, respectively) and lowest for mild AD/dementia (56.4\%).                                         Conclusions               Agitation prevalence was 44.6\% overall and 61.3\% among patients with staged AD/dementia. Behavioral disturbance appeared to be underdiagnosed. While agitation has previously been shown to be highly prevalent in the long-term care setting, this study indicates that it is also common among community-dwelling patients.},

  abstract = {Elevated erythrocyte mean corpuscular volume (MCV) may be a risk factor for peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether MCV was associated with the severity of atherosclerotic findings in the lower limbs of PAD patients, as measured by an angiographic scoring system based on vessel lumen reduction. One hundred male patients with symptomatic PAD were studied. MCV was significantly correlated with the angiographic score (rs = 0.247, p = 0.013). PAD patients with an angiographic score in the lower third were compared to those with values in the upper third using a logistic regression model with age, smoking, hypertension, MCV, homocysteine, and total cholesterol and triglycerides as independent variables. This model revealed significant odds ratios (OR) for MCV (OR = 2.02 for an increment of 5 fl, 95\% CI = 1.08-3.8) and for age (OR = 2.41 for an increment of 10 years, 95\% CI = 1.21-4.81) and facilitated classification of 71\% of all subjects correctly. In conclusion, MCV may be associated with angiographically determined disease severity in patients with PAD. This finding supports the hypothesis that MCV is a risk factor for PAD, although the mechanism by which MCV may contribute to the presence and severity of the disease is not yet determined.},

  abstract = {Stroke is a top leading cause of death, which occurs due to interference in the blood flow of the brain. Ischemic stroke (blockage) accounts for most cases (87\%) and is further subtyped into cardioembolic, atherosclerosis, lacunar, other causes, and cryptogenic strokes. The main value of subtyping ischemic stroke patients is for a better therapeutic decision-making process. The current classification methods are complex and time-consuming (hours to days). Specific blood-based biomarker measurements have promising potential to improve ischemic stroke mechanism classification. Over the past decades, the hypothesis that different blood-based biomarkers are associated with different ischemic stroke mechanisms is increasingly investigated. This review presents the recent studies that investigated blood-based biomarker characteristics differentiation between ischemic stroke mechanisms. Different blood-based biomarkers are specifically discussed (b-type natriuretic peptide, d-dimer, c-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-{$\alpha$}, interleukin-6, interleukin-1{$\beta$}, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein and apolipoprotein A), as well as the different cut-off values that may be useful in specific classifications for cardioembolic and atherosclerosis etiologies. Lastly, the structure of a point-of-care biosensor device is presented, as a measuring tool on-site. The information presented in this review will hopefully contribute to the major efforts to improve the care for stroke patients.},

  abstract = {Background:               Although sex differences in coronary artery disease are widely accepted with women developing more stable atherosclerosis than men, the underlying pathobiology of such differences remains largely unknown. In coronary artery disease, recent integrative systems biological studies have inferred gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Within these GRNs, key driver genes have shown great promise but have thus far been unidentified in women.                                         Methods:               We generated sex-specific GRNs of the atherosclerotic arterial wall in 160 women and age-matched men in the STARNET study (Stockholm-Tartu Atherosclerosis Reverse Network Engineering Task). We integrated the female GRNs with single-cell RNA-sequencing data of the human atherosclerotic plaque and single-cell RNA sequencing of advanced atherosclerotic lesions from wild type and Klf4 knockout atherosclerotic smooth muscle cell (SMC) lineage-tracing mice.                                         Results:               By comparing sex-specific GRNs, we observed clear sex differences in network activity within the atherosclerotic tissues. Genes more active in women were associated with mesenchymal cells and endothelial cells, whereas genes more active in men were associated with the immune system. We determined that key drivers of GRNs active in female coronary artery disease were predominantly found in (SMCs by single-cell sequencing of the human atherosclerotic plaques, and higher expressed in female plaque SMCs, as well. To study the functions of these female SMC key drivers in atherosclerosis, we examined single-cell RNA sequencing of advanced atherosclerotic lesions from wild type and Klf4 knockout atherosclerotic SMC lineage-tracing mice. The female key drivers were found to be expressed by phenotypically modulated SMCs and affected by Klf4, suggesting that sex differences in atherosclerosis involve phenotypic switching of plaque SMCs.                                         Conclusions:               Our systems approach provides novel insights into molecular mechanisms that underlie sex differences in atherosclerosis. To discover sex-specific therapeutic targets for atherosclerosis, an increased emphasis on sex-stratified approaches in the analysis of multi-omics data sets is warranted.},

We investigated the relationship between successful reperfusion after thrombectomy and histopathologic characteristics of retrieved thrombi.                                         Methods---               Among consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with endovascular therapy at our institute from December 2010 to July 2015, we retrospectively reviewed those with acute major arterial occlusion from which retrieved thrombi were evaluated histopathologically. Obtained thrombi were assessed for the existence of atheromatous gruel, organization, and the ratios of erythrocyte and fibrin/platelet components. Successful reperfusion was defined as the modified Treatment in Cerebral Ischemia grade of 2b to 3.                                         Results---                                Of 83 patients studied, 58 (70\%) underwent successful reperfusion. Atheromatous gruel was less frequently identified (3\% versus 20\%;                 P                 =0.024), and the proportion of erythrocyte components was higher (57{\textpm}23\% versus 47{\textpm}24\%;                 P                 =0.042) in thrombi retrieved from the reperfused than the unreperfused group. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, atheromatous gruel was inversely related (odds ratio, 0.062; 95\% confidence interval, 0.002--0.864), and {$>$}64\% erythrocyte components (cutoff obtained from receiver operating characteristic curve) were positively related (odds ratio, 4.352; 95\% confidence interval, 1.185--19.363) to successful reperfusion.

MATERIAL AND METHOD: Ischemic stroke survivors with National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) 8 were randomly allocated intofour groups, receiving aspirin, clopidogrel, combined aspirin and dipyridamole, and cilostazol. The change of MPV NIHSS, and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) were recorded at baseline and week 4 in all studied groups. MPV was measured using the standard automated blood test for complete blood count. RESULTS: Twenty-one subjects were included in this study. They comprised of five cases in each antiplatelet group, except for aspirin, which had six subjects. Male was 57\%, and hypertension was the most common risk factor (61.9\%). Most of participants (76\%) had small vessel disease. At 4-week, MPVwas reduced and NIHSS, mRS were improved in every studied group. Clopidogrel sign ficantly reduced NIHSS score (p = 0.003), and it produced the greatest reduction in MPV compared to others. CONCLUSION: Every type of antiplatelets included in this study reduced MPV NIHSS, and mRS in acute non-cardioembolic stroke patients. Clopidogrel improved NIHSS the most.},

The paper presents a comparative study about the evolution of two innovation-related policies that share a common concept. This document-centric study relies on position papers, white papers, government documents, policy documents and research program descriptions. The paper establishes that the concreteness and sophistication of the TRL scale gradually diminished as its usage spread outside its original context (space programs). A discipline-specific tailoring of the scale is essential in every area before application. Yet for a number of disciplines this has not happened, while in some other areas the available customizations and handbooks are not used in EU context. This uncritical usage of the scale in the current EU framework program seems to carry more risks than advantages. In the absence of discipline-specific guides, TRLs will predictably become a source of confusion and a subject of abuse in efforts to obtain EU funding.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Short chain fatty acids (SCFA) are gut microbiota-derived metabolites that contribute to the gut-brain axis and may impact stroke outcomes following gut dysbiosis. We evaluated plasma SCFA concentrations against stroke severity parameters and identified SCFA-associated protein networks. Methods: The Blood and Clot Thrombectomy Registry and Collaboration (BACTRAC), a continuously enrolling tissue bank, was used to obtain stroke samples. Arterial blood distal and proximal to the thrombus was obtained from Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) Patients (n=53) during thrombectomy. Patient demographics, stroke presentation and outcome parameters were reported. The SCFAs were isolated from proximal plasma via chemical derivatization UHPLC coupled tandem mass spectrometry using electrospray ionization and multiple reaction monitoring. Proteomic levels for 184 cardioembolic and inflammatory proteins was quantified from systemic and intracranial plasma by Olink. Arterial blood from cerebrovascular patients undergoing elective neurointerventional procedures was used as controls. Results: Acetate positively correlated with time from last known normal (LKN) and was significantly lower in stroke patients compared to control. Isobutyrate, Butyrate and 2-Methylbutyrate negatively correlated with \%{$\Delta$}NIHSS. Isobutyrate and 2-Methylbutyrate positively correlated with NIHSS discharge. SCFA concentrations were not associated with NIHSS admission, infarct volume, or edema volume. Multiple SCFAs positively associated with systemic and pro-inflammatory cytokines, most notably IL-6, TNF-{$\alpha$}, VCAM1, IL-17, and MCP-1. Conclusions: Plasma SCFA concentrations taken at time of stroke are not associated with stroke severity at presentation. However, higher levels of SCFAs at the time of stroke are associated with increased markers of inflammation, less recovery from admission to discharge, and worse symptom burden at discharge.},

Histologic analysis has shown that the thrombus composition is very heterogeneous between patients. However, the distribution pattern of each thrombus component often differs between patients with cardiac thrombi and those with arterial thrombi, and the efficacy of endovascular thrombectomy is different according to the thrombus composition. Furthermore, the thrombus age is related to the efficacy of reperfusion therapy. Recent studies have shown that neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular traps contribute to thrombus formation and resistance to reperfusion therapy. Histologic features of thrombi in patients with stroke may provide some clues to stroke etiology, which is helpful for determining the strategy of stroke prevention. Research on thrombus may also be helpful for improving reperfusion therapy, including the development of new thrombolytic agents.},

  abstract = {Introduction:               The histological composition of the clot influences its mechanical properties, affects the efficacy of endovascular treatment (EVT), and could determine the clinical outcome of patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Insights into clot composition may guide therapeutic decision-making prior to EVT and facilitate revascularization therapies.                                         Material and Methods:               Consecutive patients with AIS recorded in a prospective single-center reperfusion registry from December 2015 to December 2019 and treated with EVT were included. Baseline, laboratory [including post-procedural C-reactive protein (CRP)], radiological, and angiographic variables were analyzed. We aimed to study the relationship between histological composition of the clot with basal neuroimaging, laboratory markers, and recanalization technique. The secondary outcome was to analyze the correlation between clot composition and functional outcome at 3 months assessed by the modified Rankin scale (mRS).                                         Results:               From the study period, 360 AIS patients treated with EVT were included, of whom 189 (53\%) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. One hundred (53\%) cases of fibrin-predominant clot (FPC) were recorded. Full recanalization in FPC cases was achieved with higher probability when stent retrievers (SR) were selected as the first-line device (68.2\%,               p               = 0.039). Patients with FPC had higher levels of CRP (               p               = 0.02), lower frequency of the hyperdense middle cerebral artery (HMCA) in baseline imaging (               p               = 0.039), and higher rates of mortality (               p               = 0.012). The multivariate analysis showed that the absence of HMCA (OR = 0.420; 95\% CI 0.197--0.898;               p               = 0.025) and higher levels of CRP (OR = 1.01; 95\% CI 1.003--1.019;               p               = 0.008) were predictors of FPC. Leukocytes and platelet counts were not associated with clot histology.                                         Conclusions:               The absence of HMCA and higher levels of CRP were markers of FPC. In patients with FPC, complete recanalization was most likely to be achieved when a SR was selected as first line of treatment. Mortality was higher in patients within this histologic group.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The National Institutes of Health (NIH) estimates that stroke costs now exceed 45 billion dollars per year. Stroke is the third leading cause of death and one of the leading causes of adult disability in North America, Europe, and Asia. A number of well-designed randomized stroke trials and case series have now been reported in the literature to evaluate the safety and efficacy of thrombolytic therapy for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. These stroke trials have included intravenous studies, intra-arterial studies, and combinations of both, as well as use of mechanical devices for removal of thromboemboli and of neuroprotectant drugs, alone or in combination with thrombolytic therapy. At this time, the only therapy demonstrated to improve outcomes from an acute stroke is thrombolysis of the clot responsible for the ischemic event. There is room for improvement in stroke lysis studies. Divergent criteria, with disparate reporting standards and definitions, have made direct comparisons between stroke trials difficult to compare and contrast in terms of overall patient outcomes and efficacy of treatment. There is a need for more uniform definitions of multiple variables such as collateral flow, degree of recanalization, assessment of perfusion, and infarct size. In addition, there are multiple unanswered questions that require further investigation, in particular, questions as to which patients are best treated with thrombolysis. One of the most important predictors of clinical success is time to treatment, with early treatment of {$<$}3 hours for intravenous tissue plasminogen activator and {$<$}6 hours for intra-arterial thrombolysis demonstrating significant improvement in terms of 90-day clinical outcome and reduced cerebral hemorrhage. It is possible that improved imaging that identifies the ischemic penumbra and distinguishes it from irreversibly infarcted tissue will more accurately select patients for therapy than duration of symptoms. There are additional problems in the assessment of patients eligible for thrombolysis. These include being able to predict whether a particular site of occlusion can be successfully revascularized, predict an individual patient's prognosis and outcome after revascularization, and in particular, to predict the development of intracerebral hemorrhage, with and without clinical deterioration. It is not clear to assume that achieving immediate flow restoration due to thrombolytic therapy implies clinical success and improved outcome. There is no simple correlation between recanalization and observed clinical benefit in all ischemic stroke patients, because other interactive variables, such as collateral circulation, the ischemic penumbra, lesion location and extent, time to treatment, and hemorrhagic conversion, are all interrelated to outcome. METHODS: This article was written under the auspices of the Technology Assessment Committees for both the American Society of Interventional and Therapeutic Neuroradiology and the Society of Interventional Radiology. The purpose of this document is to provide guidance for the ongoing study design of trials of intra-arterial cerebral thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke. It serves as a background for the intra-arterial thrombolytic trials in North America and Europe, discusses limitations of thrombolytic therapy, defines predictors for success, and offers the rationale for the different considerations that might be important during the design of a clinical trial for intra-arterial thrombolysis in acute stroke. Included in this guidance document are suggestions for uniform reporting standards for such trials. These definitions and standards are mainly intended for research trials; however, they should also be helpful in clinical practice and applicable to all publications. This article serves to standardize reporting terminology and includes pretreatment assessment, neurologic evaluation with the NIH Stroke Scale score, imaging evaluation, occlusion sites, perfusion grades, follow-up imaging studies, and neurologic assessments. Moreover, previously used and established definitions for patient selection, outcome assessment, and data analysis are provided, with some possible variations on specific end points. This document is therefore targeted to help an investigator to critically review the scales and scores used previously in stroke trials. This article also seeks to standardize patient selection for treatment based on neurologic condition at presentation, baseline imaging studies, and utilization of standardized inclusion/exclusion criteria. It defines outcomes from therapy in phase I, II, and III studies. Statistical approaches are presented for analyzing outcomes from prospective, randomized trials with both primary and secondary variable analysis. A discussion on techniques for angiography, intra-arterial thrombolysis, anticoagulation, adjuvant therapy, and patient management after therapy is given, as well as recommendations for posttreatment evaluation, duration of follow-up, and reporting of disability outcomes. Imaging assessment before and after treatment is given. In the past, noncontrast CT brain scans were used as the initial screening examination of choice to exclude cerebral hemorrhage. However, it is now possible to quantify the volume of early infarct by using contiguous, discrete (nonhelical) images of 5 mm. In addition, CT angiography by helical scanning and 100 mL of intravenous contrast agent can be used expeditiously to obtain excellent vascular anatomy, define the occlusion site, obtain 2D and 3D reformatted vascular images, grade collateral blood flow, and perform tissue-perfusion studies to define transit times of a contrast bolus through specific tissue beds and regions of interest in the brain. Dynamic CT perfusion scans to assess the whole dynamics of a contrast agent transit curve can now be routinely obtained at many hospitals involved in these studies. The rationale, current status of this technology, and potential use in future clinical trials are given. Many hospitals are also performing MR brain studies at baseline in addition to, or instead of, CT scans. MRI has a high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of ischemic stroke in the first several hours from symptom onset, identifies arterial occlusions, and characterizes ischemic pathology noninvasively. Case series have demonstrated and characterized the early detection of intraparenchymal hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage by MRI. Echo planar images, used for diffusion MRI and, in particular, perfusion MRI are inherently sensitive for the susceptibility changes caused by intraparenchymal blood products. Consequently, MRI has replaced CT to rule out acute hemorrhage in some centers. The rationale and the potential uses of MR scanning are provided. In addition to established criteria, technology is continuously evolving, and imaging techniques have been introduced that offer new insights into the pathophysiology of acute ischemic stroke. For example, a better patient stratification might be possible if CT and/or MRI brain scans are used not only as exclusion criteria but also to provide individual inclusion and exclusion criteria based on tissue physiology. Imaging techniques might also be used as a surrogate outcome measure in future thrombolytic trials. The context of a controlled study is the best environment to validate emerging imaging and treatment techniques. The final section details reporting standards for complications and adverse outcomes; defines serious adverse events, adverse events, and unanticipated adverse events; and describes severity of complications and their relation to treatment groups. Recommendations are made regarding comparing treatment groups, randomization and blinding, intention-to-treat analysis, quality-of-life analysis, and efficacy analysis. This document concludes with an analysis of general costs associated with therapy, a discussion regarding entry criteria, outcome measures, and the variability of assessment of the different stroke scales currently used in the literature is also featured. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, this article serves to provide a more uniform set of criteria for clinical trials and reporting outcomes used in designing stroke trials involving intra-arterial thrombolytic agents, either alone or in combination with other therapies. It is anticipated that by having a more uniform set of reporting standards, more meaningful analysis of the data and the literature will be able to be achieved.},

  abstract = {Preventive interventions are often designed and tested with the immediate program period in mind, and little thought that the intervention sample might be followed up for years or even decades beyond the initial trial. However, depending on the type of intervention and the nature of the outcomes, long-term follow-up may well be appropriate. The advantages of long-term follow-up of preventive interventions are discussed and include the capacity to examine program effects across multiple later life outcomes, the ability to examine the etiological processes involved in the development of the outcomes of interest, and the ability to provide more concrete estimates of the relative benefits and costs of an intervention. In addition, researchers have identified potential methodological risks of long-term follow-up such as inflation of type 1 error through post hoc selection of outcomes, selection bias, and problems stemming from attrition over time. The present paper presents a set of seven recommendations for the design or evaluation of studies for potential long-term follow-up organized under four areas: Intervention Logic Model, Developmental Theory and Measurement Issues; Design for Retention; Dealing with Missing Data; and Unique Considerations for Intervention Studies. These recommendations include conceptual considerations in the design of a study, pragmatic concerns in the design and implementation of the data collection for long-term follow-up, as well as criteria to be considered for the evaluation of an existing intervention for potential for long-term follow-up. Concrete examples from existing intervention studies that have been followed up over the long term are provided.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Optimal management of patients with stable chest pain relies on the prognostic information provided by noninvasive cardiovascular testing, but there are limited data from randomized trials comparing anatomic with functional testing. METHODS: In the PROMISE trial (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain), patients with stable chest pain and intermediate pretest probability for obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) were randomly assigned to functional testing (exercise electrocardiography, nuclear stress, or stress echocardiography) or coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA). Site-based diagnostic test reports were classified as normal or mildly, moderately, or severely abnormal. The primary end point was death, myocardial infarction, or unstable angina hospitalizations over a median follow-up of 26.1 months. RESULTS: Both the prevalence of normal test results and incidence rate of events in these patients were significantly lower among 4500 patients randomly assigned to CTA in comparison with 4602 patients randomly assigned to functional testing (33.4\% versus 78.0\%, and 0.9\% versus 2.1\%, respectively; both P{$<$}0.001). In CTA, 54.0\% of events (n=74/137) occurred in patients with nonobstructive CAD (1\%-69\% stenosis). Prevalence of obstructive CAD and myocardial ischemia was low (11.9\% versus 12.7\%, respectively), with both findings having similar prognostic value (hazard ratio, 3.74; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 2.60-5.39; and 3.47; 95\% CI, 2.42-4.99). When test findings were stratified as mildly, moderately, or severely abnormal, hazard ratios for events in comparison with normal tests increased proportionally for CTA (2.94, 7.67, 10.13; all P{$<$}0.001) but not for corresponding functional testing categories (0.94 [P=0.87], 2.65 [P=0.001], 3.88 [P{$<$}0.001]). The discriminatory ability of CTA in predicting events was significantly better than functional testing (c-index, 0.72; 95\% CI, 0.68-0.76 versus 0.64; 95\% CI, 0.59-0.69; P=0.04). If 2714 patients with at least an intermediate Framingham Risk Score ({$>$}10\%) who had a normal functional test were reclassified as being mildly abnormal, the discriminatory capacity improved to 0.69 (95\% CI, 0.64-0.74). CONCLUSIONS: Coronary CTA, by identifying patients at risk because of nonobstructive CAD, provides better prognostic information than functional testing in contemporary patients who have stable chest pain with a low burden of obstructive CAD, myocardial ischemia, and events.

Compound                 z                 -scores were constructed for: memory, language, attention/psychomotor speed, executive functioning, and global cognitive functioning. We rated cognitive domains as impaired when                 z                 -score{$\leq-$}1.5. Based on the number of impaired domains, patients were classified as cognitively normal, minor, or major cognitive impairment. We used general linear models and {$\chi$}                 2                 tests to compare cognitive functioning between patient groups and the reference group.                                                        Results---                                Age, sex, and education adjusted global cognitive functioning z-score was lower in patients with COD ({$\beta$} [SE]=-0.46 [0.10],                 P                 {$<$}0.001) and possible VCI ({$\beta$} [SE]=-0.80 [0.09],                 P                 {$<$}0.001) compared with reference participants. On all domains,                 z                 -scores were lower in patients with COD and possible VCI compared with reference participants. Patients with HF had lower z-scores on attention/speed and language compared with reference participants. Cognitive impairment was observed in 18\% of HF, 36\% of COD, and 45\% possible VCI. There was no difference in profile of impaired cognitive domains between patient groups. Memory and attention-psychomotor speed were most commonly affected, followed by executive functioning and language.                                                        Conclusions---               A substantial part of patients with HF and COD had cognitive impairment, which warrants vigilance for the occurrence of cognitive impairment. These results underline the importance of an integrative approach in medicine in patients presenting with disorders in the heart-brain axis.},

Vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) is the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer disease, but progress in identifying molecular biomarkers for accurate diagnosis of VCID has been relatively limited. In this Review, we examine the roles of large and small vessel disease in VCID, considering the underlying pathophysiological processes that lead to vascular brain injury, including atherosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, ischaemic injury, haemorrhage, hypoperfusion, endothelial dysfunction, blood-brain barrier breakdown, inflammation, oxidative stress, hypoxia, and neuronal and glial degeneration. We consider the key molecules in these processes, including proteins and peptides, metabolites, lipids and circulating RNA, and consider their potential as molecular biomarkers alone and in combination. We also discuss the challenges in translating the promise of these biomarkers into clinical application.},

  abstract = {Background: Brain clots retrieved following endovascular thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke patients may offer unique opportunities to characterise stroke aetiology and aid stroke decision-making in select groups of patients. However, the evidence around the putative association of clot morphology with stroke aetiology is limited and remains inconclusive. This study aims to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to delineate the association of brain clot composition with stroke aetiology and post-reperfusion outcomes in patients receiving endovascular thrombectomy. Methods: The authors conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis by extracting data from several research databases (MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane, and Google Scholar) published since 2010. We used appropriate key search terms to identify clinical studies concerning stroke thrombus composition, aetiology, and clinical outcomes, in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Results: The authors identified 30 articles reporting on the relationship between stroke thrombus composition or morphology and aetiology, imaging, or clinical outcomes, of which 21 were included in the meta-analysis. The study found that strokes of cardioembolic origin (SMD = 0.388; 95\% CI, 0.032--0.745) and cryptogenic origin (SMD = 0.468; 95\% CI, 0.172--0.765) had significantly higher fibrin content than strokes of non-cardioembolic origin. Large artery atherosclerosis strokes had significantly lower fibrin content than cardioembolic (SMD = 0.552; 95\% CI, 0.099--1.004) or cryptogenic (SMD = 0.455; 95\% CI, 0.137--0.774) strokes. Greater red blood cell content was also significantly associated with a thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score of 2b--3 (SMD = 0.450; 95\% CI, 0.177--0.722), and a positive hyperdense middle cerebral artery sign (SMD = 0.827; 95\% CI, 0.472--1.183). No significant associations were found between red blood cell, platelet, or white blood cell content and aetiology, or between clot composition and bridging thrombolysis. Conclusions: This meta-analysis found that fibrin composition is significantly higher in strokes of cardioembolic and cryptogenic origin, and that red blood cell content is positively associated with the hyperdense middle cerebral artery sign and better reperfusion outcomes. Important advances to stroke clinical workup can be derived from these findings, in which many aspects of stroke workflow remain to be optimised. As data are still limited in terms of the association of various thrombus components with stroke aetiology as well as a standardised method of analysis, further studies are required to validate these findings to guide their use in clinical decision-making.},

However, despite its clinical importance, the regulatory mechanisms involved in the aggressiveness of this cancer are still poorly understood. A better understanding of the biology, genetics and molecular mechanisms of gastric cancer would be useful in developing novel targeted approaches for treating this disease. In this study we used protein-protein interaction networks and cluster analysis to comprehensively investigate the cellular pathways involved in gastric cancer. A primary immunodeficiency pathway, focal adhesion, ECM-receptor interactions and the metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450 were identified as four important pathways associated with the progression of gastric cancer. The genes in these pathways, e.g., ZAP70, IGLL1, CD79A, COL6A3, COL3A1, COL1A1, CYP2C18 and CYP2C9, may be considered as potential therapeutic targets for gastric cancer.},

  abstract = {Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) is a technique for estimating quantitative tissue properties, such as the T1 and T2 relaxation times, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and various perfusion measures. This estimation is achieved by acquiring multiple images with different acquisition parameters (or at multiple time points after injection of a contrast agent) and by fitting a qMRI signal model to the image intensities. Image registration is often necessary to compensate for misalignments due to subject motion and/or geometric distortions caused by the acquisition. However, large differences in image appearance make accurate image registration challenging. In this work, we propose a groupwise image registration method for compensating misalignment in qMRI. The groupwise formulation of the method eliminates the requirement of choosing a reference image, thus avoiding a registration bias. The method minimizes a cost function that is based on principal component analysis (PCA), exploiting the fact that intensity changes in qMRI can be described by a low-dimensional signal model, but not requiring knowledge on the specific acquisition model. The method was evaluated on 4D CT data of the lungs, and both real and synthetic images of five different qMRI applications: T1 mapping in a porcine heart, combined T1 and T2 mapping in carotid arteries, ADC mapping in the abdomen, diffusion tensor mapping in the brain, and dynamic contrast-enhanced mapping in the abdomen. Each application is based on a different acquisition model. The method is compared to a mutual information-based pairwise registration method and four other state-of-the-art groupwise registration methods. Registration accuracy is evaluated in terms of the precision of the estimated qMRI parameters, overlap of segmented structures, distance between corresponding landmarks, and smoothness of the deformation. In all qMRI applications the proposed method performed better than or equally well as competing methods, while avoiding the need to choose a reference image. It is also shown that the results of the conventional pairwise approach do depend on the choice of this reference image. We therefore conclude that our groupwise registration method with a similarity measure based on PCA is the preferred technique for compensating misalignments in qMRI.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Flexible large lumen aspiration catheters and stent retrievers have recently become available in the USA for the revascularization of large vessel occlusions presenting within the context of acute ischemic stroke (AIS). We describe a multicenter experience using a combined aspiration and stent retrieval technique for thrombectomy. DESIGN: A retrospective analysis to identify patients receiving combined manual aspiration and stent retrieval for treatment of AIS between August 2012 and April 2013 at six high volume stroke centers was conducted. Outcome variables, including recanalization rate, post-treatment National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, discharge 90 day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score, and mortality were evaluated. RESULTS: 105 patients were found that met the inclusion criteria for this retrospective study. Successful recanalization (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score 2B) was achieved in 92 (88\%) of these patients. 44\% of patients had favorable (mRS score 0-2) outcomes at 90\>days. There were five (4.8\%) symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhages and three procedure related deaths (2.9\%). CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical thrombectomy utilizing combined manual aspiration with a stent retriever is an effective and safe strategy for endovascular recanalization of large vessel occlusions presenting within the context of AIS.},

In this study, we investigated the association between thrombus composition and stroke etiology in a large population of patients from the Dutch MR CLEAN Registry treated with EVT in daily clinical practice.                                         Methods               The thrombi of 332 patients with AIS were histologically analyzed for red blood cells (RBC), fibrin/platelets (F/P), and white blood cells (leukocytes) using a machine learning algorithm. Stroke etiology was assessed using the Trial of Org 10,172 in acute stroke treatment (TOAST) classification.                                         Results                                The thrombi of cardioembolic origin contained less RBC and more F/P than those of non-cardioembolic origin (25.8\% vs 41.2\% RBC [                 p                 \,=\,0.003] and 67.1\% vs 54.5\% F/P [                 p                 \,=\,0.004]). The likelihood of a non-cardioembolic source of stroke increased with increasing thrombus RBC content (                 OR                 1.02; [95\%                 CI                 1.00--1.06] for each percent increase) and decreased with a higher F/P content (                 OR                 1.02; [95\%                 CI                 1.00--1.06]). Thrombus composition in patients with a cardioembolic origin and undetermined origin was similar.                                                        Conclusion               Thrombus composition is significantly associated with stroke etiology, with an increase in RBC and a decrease in F/P raising the odds for a non-cardioembolic cause. No difference between composition of cardioembolic thrombi and of undetermined origin was seen. This emphasizes the need for more extensive monitoring for arrhythmias and/or extended cardiac analysis in case of an undetermined origin.},

  abstract = {Immunity and inflammation are key elements of the pathobiology of stroke, a devastating illness second only to cardiac ischemia as a cause of death worldwide. The immune system participates in the brain damage produced by ischemia, and the damaged brain, in turn, exerts an immunosuppressive effect that promotes fatal infections that threaten the survival of people after stroke. Inflammatory signaling is involved in all stages of the ischemic cascade, from the early damaging events triggered by arterial occlusion to the late regenerative processes underlying post-ischemic tissue repair. Recent developments have revealed that stroke engages both innate and adaptive immunity. But adaptive immunity triggered by newly exposed brain antigens does not have an impact on the acute phase of the damage. Nevertheless, modulation of adaptive immunity exerts a remarkable protective effect on the ischemic brain and offers the prospect of new stroke therapies. As immunomodulation is not devoid of deleterious side effects, a better understanding of the reciprocal interaction between the immune system and the ischemic brain is essential to harness the full therapeutic potential of the immunology of stroke.},

Often coexisting with Alzheimer's disease, mixed vascular and neurodegenerative dementia has emerged as the leading cause of age-related cognitive impairment. Central to the disease mechanism is the crucial role that cerebral blood vessels play in brain health, not only for the delivery of oxygen and nutrients, but also for the trophic signaling that inextricably links the well-being of neurons and glia to that of cerebrovascular cells. This review will examine how vascular damage disrupts these vital homeostatic interactions, focusing on the hemispheric white matter, a region at heightened risk for vascular damage, and on the interplay between vascular factors and Alzheimer's disease. Finally, preventative and therapeutic prospects will be examined, highlighting the importance of midlife vascular risk factor control in the prevention of late-life dementia.},

  abstract = {White matter lesions are closely associated with cognitive impairment and motor dysfunction in the aged. To explore the pathophysiology of these lesions, the authors examined the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 in the white matter in a rat model of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. After bilateral clipping of the common carotid arteries, myelin staining revealed demyelinating changes in the optic tract and the corpus callosum on day 7. Zymographic analyses indicated an increase in the level of MMP-2, but not MMP-9, after the hypoperfusion. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed the presence (most abundantly on day 3) of MMP-2--expressing activated microglia in the optic tract and corpus callosum. In contrast, the capillary endothelial cells expressed MMP-2 later. IgM-immunoreactive glial cells were absent in the sham-operated animals, but were present in the hypoperfused animals by day 3, reflecting the disrupted blood--brain barrier. These findings suggest that the main sources of the elevated MMP-2 were the microglia and the endothelium, and that these cells may contribute to the remodeling of the white matter myelin and microvascular beds in chronic cerebral hypoperfusion.},

A rate-determining role for leukocyte-endothelial cell (L/E) adhesion in the initiation and propagation of reperfusion injury is supported by several reports that describe attenuated microvascular dysfunction and tissue injury following I/R in animals receiving neutralizing antibodies directed against certain leukocyte adhesion receptors and in mutant mice that are genetically deficient in these adhesion receptors The technique of intravital videomicroscopy has been applied to several tissues, including the brain, in order to directly observe the microcirculatory alterations and inflammatory responses that are elicited by I/R. The leukocyte- and platelet-endothelial cell adhesion responses to cerebral I/R are addressed and compared to responses observed in other postischemic vascular beds. The limited data available for the brain microcirculation support the potential of anti-leukocyte and anti-platelet strategies for stroke therapy.},

  abstract = {Random forests are a popular nonparametric tree ensemble procedure with broad applications to data analysis. While its widespread popularity stems from its prediction performance, an equally important feature is that it provides a fully nonparametric measure of variable importance (VIMP). A current limitation of VIMP, however, is that no systematic method exists for estimating its variance. As a solution, we propose a subsampling approach that can be used to estimate the variance of VIMP and for constructing confidence intervals. The method is general enough that it can be applied to many useful settings, including regression, classification, and survival problems. Using extensive simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the subsampling estimator and in particular find that the delete-d jackknife variance estimator, a close cousin, is especially effective under low subsampling rates due to its bias correction properties. These 2 estimators are highly competitive when compared with the .164 bootstrap estimator, a modified bootstrap procedure designed to deal with ties in out-of-sample data. Most importantly, subsampling is computationally fast, thus making it especially attractive for big data settings.},

Spontaneously hypertensive/stroke prone rats (SHR/SP) with unilateral carotid artery occlusion (UCAO) and a Japanese permissive diet (JPD) have white-matter (WM) damage similar to that seen in VCI. We hypothesized that WM injury was due to hypoxia-mediated, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption. Twelve-week-old SHR/SP had UCAO/JPD and were studied with immunohistochemistry, biochemistry, multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and Morris water maze (MWM) testing. One week after UCAO/JPD, WM showed a significant increase in hypoxia inducible factor-1{$\alpha$} (HIF-1{$\alpha$}), which increased further by 3 weeks. Prolyl hydroxylase-2 (PHD2) expression decreased at 1 and 3 weeks. Infiltrating T cells and neutrophils appeared around endothelial cells from 1 to 3 weeks after UCAO/JPD, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) colocalized with inflammatory cells. At 3 weeks, WM immunostained for IgG, indicating BBB leakage. Minocycline (50 mg/kg intraperitoneally) was given every other day from weeks 12 to 20. Multimodal MRI showed that treatment with minocycline significantly reduced lesion size and improved cerebral blood flow. Minocycline improved performance in the MWM and prolonged survival. We propose that BBB disruption occurred secondary to hypoxia, which induced an MMP-9-mediated infiltration of leukocytes. Minocycline significantly reduced WM damage, improved behavior, and prolonged life.},

  abstract = {Hypertensive small vessel disease is a major cause of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). Spontaneously hypertensive/stroke prone rats (SHR/SP) with unilateral carotid artery occlusion (UCAO) and a Japanese permissive diet (JPD) have white-matter (WM) damage similar to that seen in VCI. We hypothesized that WM injury was due to hypoxia-mediated, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption. Twelve-week-old SHR/SP had UCAO/JPD and were studied with immunohistochemistry, biochemistry, multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and Morris water maze (MWM) testing. One week after UCAO/JPD, WM showed a significant increase in hypoxia inducible factor-1{$\alpha$} (HIF-1{$\alpha$}), which increased further by 3 weeks. Prolyl hydroxylase-2 (PHD2) expression decreased at 1 and 3 weeks. Infiltrating T cells and neutrophils appeared around endothelial cells from 1 to 3 weeks after UCAO/JPD, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) colocalized with inflammatory cells. At 3 weeks, WM immunostained for IgG, indicating BBB leakage. Minocycline (50 mg/kg intraperitoneally) was given every other day from weeks 12 to 20. Multimodal MRI showed that treatment with minocycline significantly reduced lesion size and improved cerebral blood flow. Minocycline improved performance in the MWM and prolonged survival. We propose that BBB disruption occurred secondary to hypoxia, which induced an MMP-9-mediated infiltration of leukocytes. Minocycline significantly reduced WM damage, improved behavior, and prolonged life.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis hinges on detecting amyloid beta (A{$\beta$}) plaques and neurofibrillary tau ({$\tau$}) tangles, typically assessed using PET imaging. While accurate, these modalities are expensive and not widely accessible, limiting their utility in routine clinical practice. Here, we present a multimodal computational framework that integrates data from seven distinct cohorts comprising 12,~185 participants to estimate individual PET profiles using more readily available neurological assessments. Our approach achieved an AUROC of 0.79 and 0.84 in classifying A{$\beta$} and {$\tau$} status, respectively. Predicted PET status was consistent with various biomarker profiles and postmortem pathology, and model-identified regional brain volumes aligned with known spatial patterns of tau deposition. This approach can support scalable pre-screening of candidates for anti-amyloid therapies and clinical trials targeting A{$\beta$} and {$\tau$}, offering a practical alternative to direct PET imaging.},

Reactome functions both as an archive of biological processes and as a tool for discovering functional relationships in data such as gene expression profiles or somatic mutation catalogs from tumor cells. To extend our ability to annotate human disease processes, we have implemented a new drug class and have used it initially to annotate drugs relevant to cardiovascular disease. Our annotation model depends on external domain experts to identify new areas for annotation and to review new content. New web pages facilitate recruitment of community experts and allow those who have contributed to Reactome to identify their contributions and link them to their ORCID records. To improve visualization of our content, we have implemented a new tool to automatically lay out the components of individual reactions with multiple options for downloading the reaction diagrams and associated data, and a new display of our event hierarchy that will facilitate visual interpretation of pathway analysis results.},

Atherosclerosis is initiated by endothelium activation and, followed by a cascade of events (accumulation of lipids, fibrous elements, and calcification), triggers the vessel narrowing and activation of inflammatory pathways. The resultant atheroma plaque, along with these processes, results in cardiovascular complications. This review focuses on the different stages of atherosclerosis development, ranging from endothelial dysfunction to plaque rupture. In addition, the post-transcriptional regulation and modulation of atheroma plaque by microRNAs and lncRNAs, the role of microbiota, and the importance of sex as a crucial risk factor in atherosclerosis are covered here in order to provide a global view of the disease.},

We investigated the prognostic implications of stable angina pectoris in relation to the presence and degree of CAD with no obstructive CAD in focus. METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified 11 223 patients referred for coronary angiography (CAG) in 1998-2009 with stable angina pectoris as indication and 5705 participants from the Copenhagen City Heart Study for comparison. Main outcome measures were major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke or heart failure, and all-cause mortality. Significantly more women (65\%) than men (32\%) had no obstructive CAD (P{$<$} 0.001). In Cox's models adjusted for age, body mass index, diabetes, smoking, and use of lipid-lowering or antihypertensive medication, hazard ratios (HRs) associated with no obstructive CAD were similar in men and women. In the pooled analysis, the risk of MACE increased with increasing degrees of CAD with multivariable-adjusted HRs of 1.52 (95\% confidence interval, 1.27-1.83) for patients with normal coronary arteries and 1.85 (1.51-2.28) for patients with diffuse non-obstructive CAD compared with the reference population. For all-cause mortality, normal coronary arteries and diffuse non-obstructive CAD were associated with HRs of 1.29 (1.07-1.56) and 1.52 (1.24-1.88), respectively. CONCLUSION: Patients with stable angina and normal coronary arteries or diffuse non-obstructive CAD have elevated risks of MACE and all-cause mortality compared with a reference population without ischaemic heart disease.},

Methods               A total of 3052 community-dwelling residents from the Poly-vasculaR Evaluation for Cognitive Impairment and vaScular Events (PRECISE) study were involved in this cross-sectional study. CSVD burden and imaging markers, including white matter hyperintensity (WMH), lacunes, cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) and enlarged perivascular spaces in basal ganglia (BG-EPVS), were assessed according to total CSVD burden score. The associations of NC, NLR and SII with CSVD and imaging markers were evaluated using logistic regression models. Furthermore, two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed to investigate the genetically predicted effect of NC on CSVD. The prognostic performances of NC, NLR and SII for the presence of CSVD were assessed.                                         Results                                At baseline, the mean age was 61.2\,{\textpm}\,6.7~years, and 53.5\% of the participants were female. Higher NC was suggestively associated with increased total CSVD burden and modified total CSVD burden (Q4 vs. Q1: common odds ratio (cOR) 1.33, 95\% CI 1.05--1.70; cOR 1.28, 95\% CI 1.02--1.60) and marginally correlated with the presence of CSVD (OR 1.29, 95\% CI 1.00--1.66). Furthermore, elevated NC was linked to a higher risk of lacune (OR 2.13, 95\% CI 1.25--3.62) and moderate-to-severe BG-EPVS (OR 1.67, 95\% CI 1.14--2.44). A greater NLR was related to moderate-to-severe BG-EPVS (OR 1.68, 95\% CI 1.16--2.45). Individuals with a higher SII had an increased risk of modified WMH burden (OR 1.35, 95\% CI 1.08--1.69) and moderate-to-severe BG-EPVS (OR 1.70, 95\% CI 1.20--2.41). MR analysis showed that genetically predicted higher NC was associated with an increased risk of lacunar stroke (OR 1.20, 95\% CI 1.04--1.39) and small vessel stroke (OR 1.21, 95\% CI 1.06--1.38). The addition of NC to the basic model with traditional risk factors improved the predictive ability for the presence of CSVD, as validated by the net reclassification index and integrated discrimination index (all                 p                 \,{$<$}\,0.05).

At present, the underlying disease mechanisms remain under investigation, and recent studies suggest that the disease involves multiple etiological pathways. To better understand the disease and develop treatment strategies, a number of ongoing studies including the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) enroll many study participants and acquire a large number of biomarkers from various modalities including demographic, genotyping, fluid biomarkers, neuroimaging, neuropsychometric test, and clinical assessments. However, a systematic approach that can integrate all the collected data is lacking. The overarching goal of our study is to use machine learning techniques to understand the relationships among different biomarkers and to establish a system-level model that can better describe the interactions among biomarkers and provide superior diagnostic and prognostic information. In this pilot study, we use Bayesian network (BN) to analyze multimodal data from ADNI, including demographics, volumetric MRI, PET, genotypes, and neuropsychometric measurements and demonstrate our approach to have superior prediction accuracy.},

Recent data suggest that thrombus composition may impact on mechanical thrombectomy, the number of recanalization manoeuvres, resistance to retrieval, and on thrombolytic potential. Our aim was to summarize evidence describing the impact of thrombus composition on efficacy of mechanical thrombectomy and thrombolysis in patients with acute ischemic stroke. The scoping review methodology guided by the Joanna Briggs Institute, an adaption of the Arksey and O'Malley, was followed. Comprehensive searches were conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and Web of Science. Articles were classified into 4 key themes: (1) composition of stroke thrombi, (2) thrombus composition and mechanical thrombectomy, (3) thrombus composition and thrombolytic therapy, and (4) novel imaging and endovascular approaches. Our search identified 698 articles published from 1987 to June 2020. Additional articles were extracted from reference lists of the selected articles. Overall, 95 topic-specific articles identified for inclusion published in 40 different journals were included. Reports showed that thrombus composition in stroke was highly heterogeneous, containing fibrin, platelets, red blood cells, VWF (von Willebrand Factor), and neutrophil extracellular traps. Thrombi could roughly be divided into fibrin- and red blood cell--rich clots. Fibrin-rich clots were associated with increased recanalization manoeuvres, longer procedure time, and less favorable clinical outcomes compared with red blood cell--rich clots. Advances in detection or treatment of thrombi that take into account clot heterogeneity may be able to improve future endovascular and thrombolytic treatment of stroke.},

In sepsis, this shift is recognized and flagged by automated hematology analyzers, including the presence of band neutrophils, while these cells, although present, appear not to be detected in trauma patients. To better understand this suspected error in flagging, we set out to distinguish neutrophil populations of these two patient groups and compared these with controls. Different data-driven methods were used compared to standard algorithms used by the software of the analyzers. Using K-means clustering, we extracted neutrophils from raw hematology analyzer datafiles, and compared characteristics of these clusters between the patient groups. We observed an increased neutrophil size for both sepsis and trauma patients, but trauma patients had a smaller increase. Trauma patients also had a high proportion of cells with relatively high nuclear segmentation, which is contradictory with the presence of band neutrophils. This, in combination with the smaller size increase, might explain the inability to flag band neutrophils in trauma.},

  abstract = {Background               Body weight is closely related to several known cardiovascular risk factors, but it may also have an independent effect on the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). In this study, we analyzed the association between body mass index (BMI) and smoking, serum cholesterol, and blood pressure at baseline, as well as how BMI and the other risk factors are related to CHD mortality.                                         Methods and Results               A total of 16 113 men and women aged 30 to 59 years were examined in eastern Finland in either 1972 or 1977. Serum cholesterol and blood pressure had a positive association and smoking had a negative association with BMI. During the 15-year prospective follow-up, mortality from CHD was positively associated with BMI. The BMI-associated risk ratio of CHD mortality, adjusted for age and study year, estimated from the Cox proportional hazards model was 1.04 (per kg/m               2               ) (               P               {$<$}.001) among men. Inclusion of smoking in the model increased the risk ratio for BMI, whereas inclusion of serum cholesterol and blood pressure decreased it. In the model that included age, study year, and all three major cardiovascular risk factors, the BMI-associated risk ratio was 1.03 (               P               =.027). Among women, the BMI-associated risk ratio of CHD mortality adjusted for age and study year was 1.05 (               P               =.023) and the multifactorial adjusted risk ratio was 1.03 (               P               =.151).                                         Conclusions               Obesity is an independent risk factor for CHD mortality among men and also contributes to the risk of CHD among women. Part of the BMI-associated risk of CHD mortality is mediated through other known cardiovascular risk factors. By preventing overweight, a substantial part of CHD mortality may be prevented.},

  abstract = {Cerebral small vessel diseases (SVDs) are a leading cause of age and hypertension-related stroke and dementia. The salient features of SVDs visible on conventional brain magnetic resonance images include white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) on T2-weighted images, small infarcts, macrohemorrhages, dilated perivascular spaces, microbleeds and brain atrophy. Among these, WMHs are the most common and often the earliest brain tissue changes. Moreover, over the past two decades, large population- and patient-based studies have established the clinical importance of WMHs, notably with respect to cognitive and motor disturbances. Here, we seek to provide a new and critical look at the pathogenesis of SVD-associated white matter (WM) changes. We first review our current knowledge of WM biology in the healthy brain, and then consider the main clinical and pathological features of WM changes in SVDs. The most widely held view is that SVD-associated WM lesions are caused by chronic hypoperfusion, impaired cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) or blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage. Here, we assess the arguments for and against each of these mechanisms based on population, patient and experimental model studies, and further discuss other potential mechanisms. Specifically, building on two recent seminal studies that have uncovered an anatomical and functional relationship between oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and blood vessels, we elaborate on how small vessel changes might compromise myelin remodelling and cause WM degeneration. Finally, we propose new directions for future studies on this hot research topic.},

  abstract = {Background:               Among patients with clinically manifest vascular disease, the risk of recurrent vascular events is likely to vary. We assessed the distribution of estimated 10-year risk of recurrent vascular events in a secondary prevention population. We also estimated the potential risk reduction and residual risk that can be achieved if patients reach guideline-recommended risk factor targets.                                         Methods:               The SMART score (Second Manifestations of Arterial Disease) for 10-year risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, or vascular death was applied to 6904 patients with vascular disease. The risk score was externally validated in 18\,436 patients with various manifestations of vascular disease from the TNT (Treating to New Targets), IDEAL (Incremental Decrease in End Points Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering), SPARCL (Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels), and CAPRIE (Clopidogrel Versus Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischemic Events) trials. The residual risk at guideline-recommended targets was estimated by applying relative risk reductions from meta-analyses to the estimated risk for targets for systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, physical activity, and use of antithrombotic agents.                                         Results:               The external performance of the SMART risk score was reasonable, apart from overestimation of risk in patients with 10-year risk {$>$}40\%. In patients with various manifestations of vascular disease, median 10-year risk of a recurrent major vascular event was 17\% (interquartile range, 11\%--28\%), varying from {$<$}10\% in 18\% to {$>$}30\% in 22\% of the patients. If risk factors were at guideline-recommended targets, the residual 10-year risk would be {$<$}10\% in 47\% and {$>$}30\% in 9\% of the patients (median, 11\%; interquartile range, 7\%--17\%).                                         Conclusions:               Among patients with vascular disease, there is very substantial variation in estimated 10-year risk of recurrent vascular events. If all modifiable risk factors were at guideline-recommended targets, half of the patients would have a 10-year risk {$<$}10\%. These data suggest that even with optimal treatment, many patients with vascular disease will remain at {$>$}20\% and even {$>$}30\% 10-year risk, clearly delineating an area of substantial unmet medical need.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Periprocedural thrombus fragmentation is a relevant risk in endovascular stroke treatment. Because factors influencing its occurrence are largely unknown, this study addresses a potential relationship between thrombus histology and clot stability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-five patients with anterior circulation stroke treated with thrombectomy were included in this retrospective study. The number and location of emboli after retrieving the primary thrombus, the number of maneuvers, and TICI scores were evaluated. H\&E and neutrophil elastase staining of retrieved clots was performed, and semiquantitative measurements of thrombus components were correlated with procedural parameters. RESULTS: An inverse correlation between maneuvers required for thrombus retrieval and the number of distal and intermediate emboli was observed (Spearman r, -0.23; P = .032). Younger patients were at higher risk for periprocedural thrombus fragmentation (Spearman r, -0.23; P = .032). Bridging thrombolysis tended to be associated with fewer maneuvers (2 vs 3, P = .054) but more emboli (1 vs 0, P = .067). While no consistent correlation between procedural parameters and red/white blood cells and fibrin-/platelet fractions could be found, higher amounts of neutrophil elastase-positive cells within the thrombus were independently associated with the occurrence of multiple emboli (adjusted OR, 4.6; 95\% CI, 1.1-19.7; P = .041) and lower rates of complete recanalization (adjusted OR, 0.3; 95\% CI, 0.1-0.9; P = .050). CONCLUSIONS: Younger age, easy-to-retrieve thrombi, and bridging thrombolysis may be risk factors for periprocedural thrombus fragmentation. Findings from standard histologic stains did not provide insight into thrombectomy-relevant thrombus stability. However, higher neutrophil levels in the thrombus tissue were related to an increased risk of periprocedural thrombus fragmentation. This observation aligns with the proposed thrombolytic capacity of neutrophil elastase and points to its potential clinical relevance in the context of stroke thrombectomy.},

Men with hemoglobin values of 15 gm or greater and women with 14 gm or more had twice as many cerebral infarctions as did their cohorts with lower values. The risk of initial development of 82 cerebral infarctions was also strikingly related to antecedent blood pressure status in both sexes and to the cigarette habit in men. When allowance is made for associated blood pressure and cigarette habit--factors found to correlate with both blood hemoglobin values and incidence of cerebral infarction--hemoglobin level had only a modest residual effect, no longer statistically significant.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) scale is the most widely applied scoring system to grade technical results of recanalizing therapies in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). TICI 2b and TICI 3 are conventionally subsumed as 'successful recanalization'. Previous studies reported conflicting results for the clinical relevance of achieving complete (TICI 3) versus 'almost' complete reperfusion (TICI 2b). OBJECTIVE: To examine if neurologic outcome differs significantly between TICI 2b and TICI 3 in patients with AIS with middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion treated 'successfully' with mechanical thrombectomy (MTE). METHODS: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from 352 consecutive patients with isolated MCA occlusion subjected to MTE between January 2007 and July 2015. RESULTS: 262 of the 277 successfully treated patients had adequate follow-up and were included. Patients (n=119) in the TICI 3 group had a lower National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at discharge (NIHSS-DIS; median 5 vs 7, p=0.005), and showed higher rates of strong neurologic improvement ({$\Delta$}NIHSS{$\geq$}8 or NIHSS-DIS{$\leq$}1, 68.4\% vs 37.1\%, p=0.002) and favorable NIHSS outcome (NIHSS-DIS{$\leq$}5, 49.2\% vs 31.9\%, p=0.005). Hospital stays were shorter in the TICI 3 group (median 10 vs 12\>days, p=0.014). After adjusting for relevant baseline and treatment parameters, TICI 3 was independently associated with strong neurologic improvement (OR=4.3, 95\% CI 2.2 to 8.3, p{$<$}0.001) and favorable NIHSS outcome (OR=3.0, 95\% CI 1.5 to 6.3, p=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Neurologic outcome is substantially better in TICI 3 than TICI 2b patients, and hospital stays are shorter. Endovascular strategies that consequently strive to achieve TICI 3 may be warranted and cost-effective, and should be examined by future research. TICI 3 rates should be included as a safety measure in studies evaluating MTE devices and techniques.},

Since hematological parameters are routinely assessed in clinical practice, they are readily available candidates. METHODS: We used data from 3,922 vascular patients, who participated in the Second Manifestations of ARTerial Disease (SMART) study. We first investigated associations between recurrent vascular events and 22 hematological parameters, obtained from the Utrecht Patient Oriented Database (UPOD), and then assessed whether parameters associated with outcome improved risk prediction. RESULTS: After adjustment for all SMART risk score (SRS) variables, lymphocyte \%, neutrophil count, neutrophil \% and red cell distribution width (RDW) were significantly associated with vascular events. When individually added to the SRS, lymphocyte \% improved prediction of recurrent vascular events with a continuous net reclassification improvement (cNRI) of 17.4\% [95\% CI: 2.1, 32.1\%] and an increase in c-statistic of 0.011 [0.000, 0.022]. The combination of lymphocyte \% and neutrophil count resulted in a cNRI of 22.2\% [3.2, 33.4\%] and improved c-statistic by 0.011 [95\% CI: 0.000, 0.022]. Lymphocyte \% and RDW yielded a cNRI of 18.7\% [3.3, 31.9\%] and improved c-statistic by 0.016 [0.004, 0.028]. However, the addition of hematological parameters only modestly increased risk estimates for patients with an event during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Several hematological parameters were independently associated with recurrent vascular events. Lymphocyte \% alone and in combination with other parameters enhanced discrimination and reclassification. However, the incremental value for patients with a recurrent event was limited.},

  abstract = {The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO, https://hpo.jax.org) was launched in 2008 to provide a comprehensive logical standard to describe and computationally analyze phenotypic abnormalities found in human disease. The HPO is now a worldwide standard for phenotype exchange. The HPO has grown steadily since its inception due to considerable contributions from clinical experts and researchers from a diverse range of disciplines. Here, we present recent major extensions of the HPO for neurology, nephrology, immunology, pulmonology, newborn screening, and other areas. For example, the seizure subontology now reflects the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) guidelines and these enhancements have already shown clinical validity. We present new efforts to harmonize computational definitions of phenotypic abnormalities across the HPO and multiple phenotype ontologies used for animal models of disease. These efforts will benefit software such as Exomiser by improving the accuracy and scope of cross-species phenotype matching. The computational modeling strategy used by the HPO to define disease entities and phenotypic features and distinguish between them is explained in detail.We also report on recent efforts to translate the HPO into indigenous languages. Finally, we summarize recent advances in the use of HPO in electronic health record systems.},

  abstract = {The current view of the neutrophil as a short-lived, homogeneous cell type with a role limited to the elimination of pathogens during the innate immune response has begun to change. Recent studies have revealed that the lifespan of a neutrophil in circulation might be much longer, and that differential subpopulations of neutrophils and their reservoirs (marginal pools) might exist (although it still remains to be determined whether these subpopulations are functional or lineage-restricted).The classical cascade of neutrophil recruitment has been updated recently to reflect our better understanding of how this process occurs in the blood under shear stress conditions (for example, neutrophils have been found to form tethers and slings to anchor themselves to the vasculature). In addition, our understanding has improved regarding what are preferable sites of neutrophil extravasation. It is also now clear that there are exceptions to this classical cascade in a number of organs, such as the liver, lung and brain, where some steps of the cascade do not occur and/or different molecules are used by neutrophils. Furthermore, we recognize there might be differences between sterile and infectious inflammation.Once extravasated, neutrophils follow a hierarchy of chemotactic molecules to reach the site of inflammation, following first 'intermediate' chemoattractants (endogenous chemokines) and then later 'end-target' chemoattractants (bacterial peptides or complement components). The process of chemotaxis is controlled by multiple intracellular signalling pathways (mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent) controlling 'go' and 'stop' signals.Despite the pre-existing dogma that neutrophils leave the vasculature and die, it has been revealed that some extravasated neutrophils might re-enter circulation, leading to the dissemination of inflammation to other organs and subsequent tissue injury. In other cases, transmigrating cells may play an important part in the resolution of inflammation. In fact, neutrophils were shown to participate in wound healing and to actively limit self-recruitment through the release of endogenous molecules that inhibit integrin activation or cytoskeletal changes.Newly described roles of neutrophils cover their involvement in adaptive immunity by controlling the activation of T and B cells, and through the presentation of antigens to professional antigen-presenting cells in lymph nodes.Neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, a strategy of pathogen eradication discovered less than a decade ago, has now been described to occur in vivo not only during acute (bacterial or viral) inflammation but also in numerous pathological conditions, such as autoimmune diseases, vascular diseases and cancer. Recently described mechanisms of NET formation indicate that neutrophils releasing NETs in vivo do not immediately die but rather keep performing functions such as chemotaxis and phagocytosis.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Several studies have demonstrated that inflammation plays a major role in the development of atherosclerosis and that the inflammatory process might also be involved in coronary artery calcification (CAC). The main purpose of this study was to investigate the relation between leucocyte count and CAC and to determine whether a higher leucocyte count could indicate subclinical atherosclerosis in patients without overt cardiovascular disease. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 284 consecutive patients (156 men, 128 women) without established cardiovascular disease were enrolled. CAC was measured using cardiac computed tomography. Leucocyte count was measured via routine blood examination. RESULTS: Patients with CAC had higher leucocyte counts compared to those without calcification (7.87{\textpm}1.85 vs. 6.01{\textpm}1.84; p{$<$}0.001). Logistic regression analysis identified the following as independent predictors of CAC: leucocyte count (odds ratio [OR]: 1.7, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3-2.1), smoking (OR: 2.4, 95\% CI: 1.2-4.6) and age (OR: 1.2, 95\% CI: 1.1-2.3). There was also a significant correlation between CAC and leucocyte count (r=0.57, p{$<$}0.001). CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that leucocytes may play an important role in the evolution of CAC and may be used in the detection of subclinical atherosclerosis in asymptomatic subjects.},

  abstract = {No comprehensive review of Bayesian networks (BNs) in healthcare has been published in the past, making it difficult to organize the research contributions in the present and identify challenges and neglected areas that need to be addressed in the future. This unique and novel scoping review of BNs in healthcare provides an analytical framework for comprehensively characterizing the domain and its current state. A literature search of health and health informatics literature databases using relevant keywords found 3810 articles that were reduced to 123. This was after screening out those presenting Bayesian statistics, meta-analysis or neural networks, as opposed to BNs and those describing the predictive performance of multiple machine learning algorithms, of which BNs were simply one type. Using the novel analytical framework, we show that: (1) BNs in healthcare are not used to their full potential; (2) a generic BN development process is lacking; (3) limitations exist in the way BNs in healthcare are presented in the literature, which impacts understanding, consensus towards systematic methodologies, practice and adoption; and (4) a gap exists between having an accurate BN and a useful BN that impacts clinical practice. This review highlights several neglected issues, such as restricted aims of BNs, ad hoc BN development methods, and the lack of BN adoption in practice and reveals to researchers and clinicians the need to address these problems. To map the way forward, the paper proposes future research directions and makes recommendations regarding BN development methods and adoption in practice.},

During the last 25 years, diffusion MRI has been extraordinarily successful (with more than 300,000 entries on Google Scholar for diffusion MRI). Its main clinical domain of application has been neurological disorders, especially for the management of patients with acute stroke. It is also rapidly becoming a standard for white matter disorders, as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can reveal abnormalities in white matter fiber structure and provide outstanding maps of brain connectivity. The ability to visualize anatomical connections between different parts of the brain, non-invasively and on an individual basis, has emerged as a major breakthrough for neurosciences. The driving force of dMRI is to monitor microscopic, natural displacements of water molecules that occur in brain tissues as part of the physical diffusion process. Water molecules are thus used as a probe that can reveal microscopic details about tissue architecture, either normal or in a diseased state.},

  abstract = {Background and purpose               Previous studies have reported that early hospital arrival improves clinical outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke; however, whether early arrival is associated with favorable outcomes regardless of reperfusion therapy and the type of stroke onset time is unclear. Thus, we investigated the impact of onset-to-door time on outcomes and evaluated the predictors of pre-hospital delay after ischemic stroke.                                         Methods               Consecutive acute ischemic stroke patients who arrived at the hospital within five days of onset from September 2019 to May 2020 were selected from the prospective stroke registries of Seoul National University Hospital and Chung-Ang University Hospital of Seoul, Korea. Patients were divided into early (onset-to-door time, {$\leq$}4.5 h) and late ({$>$}4.5 h) arrivers. Multivariate analyses were performed to assess the effect of early arrival on clinical outcomes and predictors of late arrival.                                         Results               Among the 539 patients, 28.4\% arrived early and 71.6\% arrived late. Early hospital arrival was significantly associated with favorable outcomes (three-month modified Rankin Scale [mRS]: 0-2, adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.03, 95\% confidence interval: [CI] 1.04--3.96) regardless of various confounders, including receiving reperfusion therapy and type of stroke onset time. Furthermore, a lower initial National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score (aOR: 0.94, 95\% CI: 0.90--0.97), greater pre-stroke mRS score (aOR: 1.58, 95\% CI: 1.18--2.13), female sex (aOR: 1.71, 95\% CI: 1.14--2.58), unclear onset time, and {$\leq$}6 years of schooling (aOR: 1.76, 95\% CI: 1.03--3.00 compared to {$>$}12 years of schooling) were independent predictors of late arrival.                                         Conclusions               Thus, the onset-to-door time of{$\leq$}4.5 h is crucial for better clinical outcome, and lower NIHSS score, greater pre-stroke mRS score, female sex, unclear onset times, and {$\leq$}6 years of schooling were independent predictors of late arrival. Therefore, educating about the importance of early hospital arrival after acute ischemic stroke should be emphasized. More strategic efforts are needed to reduce the prehospital delay by understanding the predictors of late arrival.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Major disparities between women and men in the diagnosis, management, and outcomes of acute coronary syndrome are well recognized. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of implementing a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I assay with sex-specific diagnostic thresholds for myocardial infarction in women and men with suspected acute coronary syndrome. METHODS: Consecutive patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome were enrolled in a stepped-wedge, cluster-randomized controlled trial across 10 hospitals. Myocardial injury was defined as high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I concentration {$>$}99th centile of 16~ng/l in women and 34~ng/l in men. The primary outcome was recurrent myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death at 1 year. RESULTS: A total of 48,282 patients (47\% women) were included. Use of the high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I assay with sex-specific thresholds increased myocardial injury in women by 42\% and in men by 6\%. Following implementation, women with myocardial injury remained less likely than men to undergo coronary revascularization (15\% vs. 34\%) and to receive dual antiplatelet (26\% vs. 43\%), statin (16\% vs. 26\%), or other preventive therapies (p~{$<~$}0.001 for all). The primary outcome occurred in 18\% (369 of 2,072) and 17\% (488 of 2,919) of women with myocardial injury before and after implementation, respectively (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.11; 95\% confidence interval: 0.92 to 1.33), compared with 18\% (370 of 2,044) and 15\% (513 of 3,325) of men (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.85; 95\% confidence interval: 0.71 to 1.01). CONCLUSIONS: Use of sex-specific thresholds identified 5 times more additional women than men with myocardial injury. Despite this increase, women received approximately one-half the number of treatments for coronary artery~disease as men, and outcomes were not improved.

Methods: We included 439 participants (124 HF; 75 COD; 127 possible VCI; 113 reference participants) from the Dutch multi-center Heart-Brain Study. We used pseudo-continuous ASL to estimate whole-brain and regional partial volume-corrected CBF. Neuropsychological tests covered global cognition and four cognitive domains. Results: CBF values were lowest in COD, followed by VCI and HF, compared to reference participants. This did not explain cognitive impairment, as we did not find an association between CBF and cognitive functioning. Discussion: We found that reduced CBF is not the major explanatory factor underlying cognitive impairment in patients with hemodynamic dysfunction along the heart-brain axis.},

Several population studies have shown, however, that it is only moderately sensitive (60-68\%), although highly specific (90-100\%). In this study, reasons for the poor sensitivity and good specificity were determined following its application to 586 claudicants and to 61 subjects with other causes of leg pain. The results showed two important findings: firstly, that over half of the false negatives were produced by one question alone; and secondly that only three questions were required to maintain the specificity of the questionnaire. This knowledge, in conjunction with the pre-testing of additional questions, enabled a new questionnaire to be constructed: the "Edinburgh Claudication Questionnaire". This questionnaire was tested on 300 subjects aged over 55 years attending their general practitioner, and found to be 91.3\% (95\% CI 88.1-94.5\%) sensitive and 99.3\% (95\% CI 98.9-100\%) specific in comparison to the diagnosis of intermittent claudication made by a physician. The repeatability of the questionnaire after 6 months was excellent (kappa = 0.76, p {$<$} 0.001). These results suggest that this revised version of the WHO/Rose Questionnaire should be adopted for use in future epidemiological surveys of peripheral vascular disease.},

Design A systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA). The observational group was set as a reference to collect all existing RFs and compare them with each other. Setting and Participants An exhaustive and comprehensive literature search strategy was used to identify relevant prospective cohort studies from several online databases from their inception to May 1, 2019. Participants without dementia were adults aged greater than 50~years. Measures The required data were extracted from the eligible studies to facilitate the Bayesian NMA. Results Forty-three cohort studies with 277,294 participants were included in this NMA. Using the observation group as the reference, all defined RFs, except for antioxidants, were associated with lower risks of all-cause dementia [no sleep disturbances (odds ratio, OR 0.43, 95\% credible interval, CrI 0.24--0.62), a high level of education (OR 0.50, 95\% CrI 0.34--0.66), no history of diabetes (OR 0.57, 95\% CrI 0.36--0.78), nonobese patients (OR 0.61, 95\% CrI 0.39--0.83), no smoking history (OR 0.62, 95\% CrI 0.45--0.79), living with family members (OR 0.67, 95\% CrI 0.45--0.89), participation in physical exercise (OR 0.73, 95\% CrI 0.46--0.94), abstinence from drinking (OR 0.78, 95\% CrI 0.56--0.99), and no history of hypertension (OR 0.80, 95\% CrI 0.65--0.96)].

Little is known about the pathophysiological basis for the close association of GDF-15 to future CV events. We hypothesized that GDF-15 is related to underlying CV pathologies. METHODS AND RESULTS: To relate the levels of GDF-15 to indices of CV dysfunction and disease in elderly individuals, serum levels of GDF-15 were measured in 1004 subjects aged 70 years from the Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS) study. Carotid intima-media thickness and plaque burden, and left ventricular (LV) geometry and function were assessed by ultrasound. Endothelial function was evaluated in forearm resistance vessels and in the brachial artery by venous occlusion plethysmography and ultrasound imaging, respectively. Elevated levels of GDF-15 were related to several CV risk factors (male gender, current smoking, body mass index, waist circumference, diabetes, fasting glucose, triglycerides, and low HDL cholesterol). After adjustment for CV risk factors, increased levels of GDF-15 were associated with reduced endothelium-dependent vasodilation in resistance vessels, plaque burden, LV mass and concentric LV hypertrophy, reduced LV ejection fraction, and clinical manifestations of coronary artery disease and heart failure. CONCLUSION: GDF-15 carries information on CV dysfunction and disease that is not captured by traditional CV risk factors in elderly individuals.},

  abstract = {Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex disease that is caused by an impairment in the secretion of {$\beta$}-cell insulin and by a peripheral resistance to insulin. Most patients suffering from T2DM and from obesity exhibit insulin resistance in the muscles, liver, and fat, resulting in a reduced response of these tissues to insulin. In healthy individuals, pancreatic islet {$\beta$}-cells secrete insulin to regulate the increase in blood glucose levels. Once these {$\beta$}-cells fail to function, T2DM develops. Despite the progress achieved in this field in recent years, the genetic causes for insulin resistance and for T2DM have not yet been fully discovered. The present study aims to characterize T2DM by comparing its gene expression with that of normal controls, as well as to identify biomarkers for early T2DM. Gene expression profiles were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified for type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, functional analyses were conducted for the gene ontology and for the pathway enrichment. In total, 781 DEGs were identified in the T2DM samples relative to healthy controls. These genes were found to be involved in several biological processes, including cell communication, cell proliferation, cell shape, and apoptosis. We constructed a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, and the clusters in the PPI were analyzed by using ClusterONE. Six functional genes that may play important roles in the initiation of T2DM were identified within the network.},

  abstract = {Ischemic stroke (IS) is the second leading cause of death worldwide. Multimodal neuroimaging techniques that have significantly facilitated the diagnosis of hyperacute IS are not widely used in underdeveloped areas and community hospitals owing to drawbacks such as high cost and lack of trained operators. Moreover, these methods do not have sufficient resolution to detect changes in the brain at the cellular and molecular levels after IS onset. In contrast, blood-based biomarkers can reflect molecular and biochemical alterations in both normal and pathophysiologic processes including angiogenesis, metabolism, inflammation, oxidative stress, coagulation, thrombosis, glial activation, and neuronal and vascular injury, and can thus provide information complementary to findings from routine examinations and neuroimaging that is useful for diagnosis. In this review, we summarize the current state of knowledge on blood-based biomarkers of hyperacute IS including those associated with neuronal injury, glial activation, inflammation and oxidative stress, vascular injury and angiogenesis, coagulation and thrombosis, and metabolism as well as genetic and genomic biomarkers. Meanwhile, the blood sampling time of the biomarkers which are cited and summarized in the review is within 6 h after the onset of IS. Additionally, we also discuss the diagnostic and prognostic value of blood-based biomarkers in stroke patients, and future directions for their clinical application and development.},

The systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) has been shown to be an independent predictor of many diseases associated with inflammation, but the relationship between the SII and POCD is unknown. We aimed to investigate the association between POCD and SII levels to examine the potential of SII in predicting POCD in elderly patients. The present study was carried out among elderly patients who underwent elective orthopedics operation in our hospital, and SII, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte to lymphocyte ratio (MLR) were calculated from the admission blood sample. POCD was measured by Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) in elderly patients. The association between SII levels and POCD was analyzed by binary logistic regression analysis. Finally, 19 (25\%) of 76 patients were diagnosed with POCD. Compared with Non-POCD patients, POCD patients showed significantly higher levels of NLR, MLR, SII, especially SII at admission. SII was independently associated with the occurrence of POCD through the logistic regression analysis. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that preoperative SII was a significant predictor for POCD, and the area under the curve was 0.909. Our data suggest that preoperative NLR, MLR, SII levels in the blood are related to the occurrence of POCD. Preoperative SII level is a prognostic biomarker of POCD in elderly patients after orthopedics operation. More clinical studies are needed to further verify the value of SII in POCD.},

However, the genetic alterations and molecular mechanism of the early onset CRCs are not fully investigated. The present study aimed to characterize early onset CRC by analyzing its gene expression compared with normal controls and to identify network-based biomarkers of early onset CRC. The gene expression profiles of early onset CRC were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in CRC patients were identified. Then, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed and the clusters in PPI were analyzed by ClusterONE. Furthermore, the gene ontology functional analysis and pathway enrichment analysis were conducted to the modules in PPI network. A systems biology approach integrating microarray data and PPI was further applied to construct a PPI network in CRC. Total 631 DEGs were identified from the early onset CRC compared to healthy controls. These genes were found to be involved in several biological processes, including cell communication, cell proliferation, cell shape and apoptosis. Five functional modules which may play important roles in the initiation of early onset CRC were identified from the PPI network. Functional annotation revealed that these five modules were involved in the pathways of signal transduction, carcinogenesis and metastasis. The hub nodes of these five modules, CDC42, TEX11, QKI, CAV1 and FN1, may serve as the biomarkers of early onset CRC and have the potential to be targets for therapeutic intervention. However, further investigations are still needed to confirm our findings.},

The most widely used contemporary cardiovascular biomarkers are the natriuretic peptides in the diagnosis and prognosis of heart failure and cardiac troponins in the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. Numerous other biomarkers pertaining to diagnosis, prognosis, and risk prediction have been identified, but few have made their way to clinical practice. In this review, we will initially describe the fundamental approach to evaluate a novel biomarker. Before implementation of a biomarker into clinical practice, several stringent criteria related to its clinical utility are required. Essential statistical metrics such as discrimination, calibration, and reclassification are required to properly evaluate prediction models. We will then discuss the biomarkers according to main groups of cardiovascular pathology:1. {$\quad$}myocardial injury (cardiac troponins, heart-type fatty acid-binding protein, cardiac myosin binding protein-C);2. {$\quad$}myocardial stress (A-type and B-type natriuretic peptides, mid-regional pro-adrenomedullin, copeptin); 3. {$\quad$}inflammation (C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, growth differentiation factor 15, soluble suppressor of tumorigenicity 2, galectin-3);4. {$\quad$}platelet activation (soluble CD40 ligand, P-selectin);5. {$\quad$}plaque instability (lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2, matrix metalloproteinase-9);6. {$\quad$}systemic stress (catecholamines, granin proteins);7. {$\quad$}calcium homeostasis (secretoneurin). Finally, we will discuss novel applications of cardiovascular biomarkers, more specifically prediction of ventricular arrhythmias, and the use of biomarkers in composite risk prediction models.},

  abstract = {One of the most important causes of neurological morbidity and mortality in the world is ischemic stroke. It can be a result of multiple events such as embolism with a cardiac origin, occlusion of small vessels in the brain, and atherosclerosis affecting the cerebral circulation. Increasing evidence shows the intricate function played by the immune system in the pathophysiological variations that take place after cerebral ischemic injury. Following the ischemic cerebral harm, we can observe consequent neuroinflammation that causes additional damage provoking the death of the cells; on the other hand, it also plays a beneficial role in stimulating remedial action. Immune mediators are the origin of signals with a proinflammatory position that can boost the cells in the brain and promote the penetration of numerous inflammatory cytotypes (various subtypes of T cells, monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils, and different inflammatory cells) within the area affected by ischemia; this process is responsible for further ischemic damage of the brain. This inflammatory process seems to involve both the cerebral tissue and the whole organism in cardioembolic stroke, the stroke subtype that is associated with more severe brain damage and a consequent worse outcome (more disability, higher mortality). In this review, the authors want to present an overview of the present learning of the mechanisms of inflammation that takes place in the cerebral tissue and the role of the immune system involved in ischemic stroke, focusing on cardioembolic stroke and its potential treatment strategies.},

Hence, we decided to investigate the activation patterns among different platelet populations differentiated by size, and to compare the inhibitory effects of aspirin in these populations. Circulating platelets from 9 healthy volunteers were separated by size and stratified into the largest and smallest quintiles. Platelets were stimulated with 75 {$\mu$}M arachidonic acid (AA), 10 {$\mu$}M ADP or 25 {$\mu$}M TRAP. Alpha-granule protein secretion and expression (P-selectin, VWF, fibrinogen), surface-protein activation (activated integrin {$\alpha$}IIb{$\beta$}3) were assessed. Platelet thromboxane B(2) (TxB(2)) synthesis following AA stimulation was measured in vitro before and after incubation with 265 {$\mu$}M aspirin. Reticulated (juvenile) platelets were assessed using thiazole orange staining. A greater number of large platelets in the largest quintile were reticulated compared with the smallest quintile (6.1 {\textpm} 2.8\% vs. 1.2 {\textpm} 1.5\% respectively, p {$<$} 0.001). Larger platelets also synthesized more TxB(2) than small platelets both before (1348 {\textpm} 276 pg/mL vs. 1023 {\textpm} 214 pg/mL, respectively, p = 0.01) and after aspirin (1029 {\textpm} 190 pg/mL vs. 851 {\textpm} 159 pg/mL, respectively, p = 0.03). After stimulation with each agonist, a greater proportion of large platelets bound fibrinogen, VWF, P-selectin and activated integrin {$\alpha$}IIb{$\beta$}3 than small platelets both in the presence and in the absence of in vitro aspirin. In an in vitro setting, large platelets appear to be more active than small platelets and continue to be more active even after in vitro aspirin. Platelets exhibit heterogeneity in size and structure. Whether this translates into platelet function and efficacy of antiplatelet therapy is unclear. We evaluated platelet functional properties and the effects of aspirin on separated platelet subpopulations in an in vitro setting. Platelets were sorted into the largest and smallest size quintiles using flow cytometry forward scatter. Alpha-granule protein release, dense granule content, surface protein activation and thromboxane synthesis were significantly greater in large platelets compared with small platelets, before and after stimulation with arachidonic acid, ADP and TRAP. Even after incubation with aspirin, large platelets continued to be more active than small platelets. In conclusion, large platelets are more active than small platelets and aspirin fails to eliminate these differential activation properties.},

We subjected young (5-6 months), middle aged (14-15 months) and aged (20-22 months), C57BL/6 male and female mice to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and found that a significant age by sex interaction influenced histological stroke outcomes. Acute functional outcomes were worse with aging. Neutrophils, inflammatory macrophages, macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs) and microglia significantly increased in the brain post MCAO. Cycling females had higher Gr1(-) non-inflammatory macrophages and lower T cells in the brain after stroke and these correlated with serum estradiol levels. Estrogen loss in acyclic aged female mice exacerbated stroke induced splenic contraction. Advanced age increased T cells, DCs and microglia at the site of injury, which may be responsible for the exacerbated behavioral deficits in the aged. We conclude that aging and sex have differential effects on the post stroke inflammatory milieu. Putative immunomodulatory therapies need to account for this heterogeneity.},

  abstract = {Background: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are the leading cause of the social burden of dementia but their role is underestimated. Objective: The objective of the study was to validate predictive models to separately identify psychotic and depressive symptoms in patients diagnosed with dementia using clinical databases representing the whole population to inform decision-makers. Methods: First, we searched the electronic health records of 4,003 patients with dementia to identify NPS. Second, machine learning (random forest) algorithms were applied to build separate predictive models for psychotic and depressive symptom clusters in the training set (N{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}3,003). Third, calibration and discrimination were assessed in the test set (N{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}1,000) to assess the performance of the models. Results: Neuropsychiatric symptoms were noted in the electronic health record of 58\% of patients. The area under the receiver operating curve reached 0.80 for the psychotic cluster model and 0.74 for the depressive cluster model. The Kappa index and accuracy also showed better discrimination in the psychotic model. Calibration plots indicated that both types of model had less predictive accuracy when the probability of neuropsychiatric symptoms was {$<$}25\%. The most important variables in the psychotic cluster model were use of risperidone, level of sedation, use of quetiapine and haloperidol and the number of antipsychotics prescribed. In the depressive cluster model, the most important variables were number of antidepressants prescribed, escitalopram use, level of sedation, and age. Conclusion: Given their relatively good performance, the predictive models can be used to estimate prevalence of NPS in population databases.},

  abstract = {Flow cytometry is a technology that provides rapid multi-parametric analysis of single cells in solution. Flow cytometers utilize lasers as light sources to produce both scattered and fluorescent light signals that are read by detectors such as photodiodes or photomultiplier tubes. These light signals are converted into electronic signals that are analyzed by a computer and written to a standardized format (.fcs) data file. Cell populations can be analyzed and/or purified based on their fluorescent or light scattering characteristics. A variety of fluorescent reagents are utilized in flow cytometry. These include fluorescently conjugated antibodies, nucleic acid binding dyes, viability dyes, ion indicator dyes, and fluorescent expression proteins. Flow cytometry is a powerful tool that has applications in immunology, molecular biology, bacteriology, virology, cancer biology, and infectious disease monitoring. It has seen dramatic advances over the last 30 years, allowing unprecedented detail in studies of the immune system and other areas of cell biology. {\copyright} 2018 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

Hitherto, research works have not investigated the types of medical conditions being modelled with BNs, nor whether there are any differences in how and why they are applied to different conditions. This research seeks to identify and quantify the range of medical conditions for which healthcare-related BN models have been proposed, and the differences in approach between the most common medical conditions to which they have been applied. We found that almost two-thirds of all healthcare BNs are focused on four conditions: cardiac, cancer, psychological and lung disorders. We believe there is a lack of understanding regarding how BNs work and what they are capable of, and that it is only with greater understanding and promotion that we may ever realise the full potential of BNs to effect positive change in daily healthcare practice.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        Introduction             Histological assessment studies have identified the presence of intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH) as an indicator of plaque instability and resulting ischemic cerebral sequelae. Although the presence of IPH has been studied extensively in relation to neurological symptoms preceding carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or as a predictor for postoperative risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), the degree of IPH has not been studied before. Glycophorin, an erythrocyte-specific protein, has been suggested as a marker for the degree of previous hemorrhages in atherosclerotic plaque since erythrocytes are prominently present in IPH. We hypothesized that quantified plaque glycophorin C, as a proxy for the degree of IPH, is associated with destabilizing plaque characteristics, preprocedural symptoms, and increased postoperative risk for MACE.                                   Methods             We quantified glycophorin C and six other plaque characteristics with the slideToolkit method. We used human atherosclerotic plaque samples from 1971 consecutive asymptomatic and symptomatic (carotid endarterectomy) patients in the Athero-Express Biobank.                                   Results             The total area of glycophorin C in plaque was larger in individuals with a plaque with IPH compared to individuals with plaque without IPH (p{$<$}0.001). Quantified glycophorin C was significantly associated with ipsilateral pre-procedural neurological symptoms (OR:1.27, 95\%CI:1.06-1.41, p=0.005). In addition, quantified glycophorin C was independently associated with an increased postoperative risk for MACE (HR:1.31, 95\%CI:1.01-1.68, p=0.04). Stratified by sex, quantified glycophorin C was associated with an increased postoperative risk for MACE in male patients (HR:1.50, 95\%CI:1.13-1.97, p=0.004), but not in female patients (HR:0.70, 95\%CI:0.39-1.27, p=0.23).                                   Conclusion             Quantified glycophorin C, as a proxy for the degree of IPH, was independently associated with the presence of IPH, symptomatic preprocedural symptoms, and with an increased three-year postoperative risk of MACE. These findings indicate that quantified plaque glycophorin C can be considered as a marker for identifying male patients with a high residual risk for secondary MACE after CEA.},

During a hackathon, we aimed to identify and predict D2T RA patients in structured and unstructured routine care data.                                         Methods               Routine care data of 1873 RA patients were extracted from the Utrecht Patient Oriented Database. Data from a previous cross-sectional study, in which 152 RA patients were clinically classified as either D2T or non-D2T, served as a validation set. Machine learning techniques, text mining, and feature importance analyses were performed to identify and predict D2T RA patients based on structured and unstructured routine care data.                                         Results               We identified 123 potentially new D2T RA patients by applying the D2T RA definition in structured and unstructured routine care data. Additionally, we developed a D2T RA identification model derived from a feature importance analysis of all available structured data (AUC-ROC 0.88 (95\% CI 0.82--0.94)), and we demonstrated the potential of longitudinal hematological data to differentiate D2T from non-D2T RA patients using supervised dimension reduction. Lastly, using data up to the time of starting the first biological treatment, we predicted future development of D2TRA (AUC-ROC 0.73 (95\% CI 0.71--0.75)).                                         Conclusions               During this hackathon, we have demonstrated the potential of different techniques for the identification and prediction of D2T RA patients in structured as well as unstructured routine care data. The results are promising and should be optimized and validated in future research.},

Methods: The review is based on a large literature search in MEDLINE (through PubMed), conference proceedings, and the ACM Digital Library, focusing only on research published between 2005 and early 2016. Each selected publication was reviewed by the authors, and a structured analysis and summarization of its content was developed.             Results: The initial search produced 359 publications, reduced after a manual examination of abstracts and full publications. The following aspects of clinical data reuse are discussed: motivations and challenges, privacy and ethical concerns, data integration and interoperability, data models and terminologies, unstructured data reuse, structured data mining, clinical practice and research integration, and examples of clinical data reuse (quality measurement and learning healthcare systems).

  abstract = {Sex or gender differences in the risk of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) differ by world region, suggesting that there are potentially modifiable risk factors for intervention. However, few epidemiological or clinical ADRD studies examine sex differences; even fewer evaluate gender in the context of ADRD risk. The goals of this perspective are to: (1) provide definitions of gender, biologic sex, and sexual orientation. and the limitations of examining these as binary variables; (2) provide an overview of what is known with regard to sex and gender differences in the risk, prevention, and diagnosis of ADRD; and (3) discuss these sex and gender differences from a global, worldwide perspective. Identifying drivers of sex and gender differences in ADRD throughout the world is a first step in developing interventions unique to each geographical and sociocultural area to reduce these inequities and to ultimately reduce global ADRD risk. HIGHLIGHTS: The burden of dementia is unevenly distributed geographically and by sex and gender. Scientific advances in genetics and biomarkers challenge beliefs that sex is binary. Discrimination against women and sex and gender minority (SGM) populations contributes to cognitive decline.

  abstract = {Worldwide, around 50 million people live with dementia, and this number is projected to triple by 2050. It has been estimated that 20\% of all dementia cases have a predominant cerebrovascular pathology, while perhaps another 20\% of vascular diseases contribute to a mixed dementia picture. Therefore, the vascular contribution to dementia affects 20 million people currently and will increase markedly in the next few decades, particularly in lower- and middle-income countries.In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) and review management. VCI refers to the spectrum of cerebrovascular pathologies that contribute to any degree of cognitive impairment, ranging from subjective cognitive decline, to mild cognitive impairment, to dementia. While acute cognitive decline occurring soon after a stroke is the most recognized form of VCI, chronic cerebrovascular disease, in particular cerebral small-vessel disease, can cause insidious cognitive decline in the absence of stroke. Moreover, cerebrovascular disease not only commonly co-occurs with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and increases the probability that AD pathology will result in clinical dementia, but may also contribute etiologically to the development of AD pathologies.Despite its enormous health and economic impact, VCI has been a neglected research area, with few adequately powered trials of therapies, resulting in few proven treatments. Current management of VCI emphasizes prevention and treatment of stroke and vascular risk factors, with most evidence for intensive hypertension control. Reperfusion therapies in acute stroke may attenuate the risk of VCI. Associated behavioral symptoms such as apathy and poststroke emotionalism are common. We also highlight novel treatment strategies that will hopefully lead to new disease course-modifying therapies. Finally, we highlight the importance of including cognitive endpoints in large cardiovascular prevention trials and the need for an increased research focus and funding for this important area.},

Methods---                              We evaluated 72 patients with acute stroke caused by proximal MCA occlusion treated with intravenous tPA in {$<$}3 hours. Transcranial Doppler monitoring of recanalization was conducted during tPA infusion and at 6 hours. Strokes were categorized as large-vessel disease strokes, cardioembolic strokes, or strokes of undetermined origin according to Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment criteria.                                                          Results---                              During 1-hour tPA infusion, recanalization occurred in 34 patients (47\%); 32\% showed a sudden, 50\% showed a stepwise, and 18\% showed a slow pattern of recanalization. One-hour recanalization was more frequent in patients with cardioembolic stroke (59\%) compared with large-vessel disease (8\%) and undetermined origin (50\%) strokes. A cardiac source of emboli was identified in 81\% of patients who showed a sudden clot breakup during tPA infusion. Rate of complete recanalization at 6 hours was higher (               P               =0.006) in patients with cardioembolic stroke (50\%) compared with other stroke subtypes (27\%). Sudden recanalization was associated (               P               =0.002) with a higher degree of neurological improvement at 24 hours compared with stepwise, slow, and no recanalization. A graded response in long-term outcome was observed in relation to the speed of clot lysis during tPA administration.                                                          Conclusions---                              We demonstrate that the pattern of tPA-induced MCA recanalization differs among stroke subtypes.

  abstract = {Abstract             The red blood cell (RBC) distribution width (RDW) is a measurement of the size variation as well as an index of the heterogeneity of the erythrocytes (i.e., anysocytosis), which is typically used in combination with the mean corpuscular volume to troubleshoot the cause of an underlying anemia. Reliable data emerged from a variety of clinical studies have, however, disclosed a new and unpredictable scenario in the clinical usefulness of this measure, supporting the hypothesis that RDW might be a useful parameter for gathering meaningful clinical information, either diagnostic or prognostic, on a variety of cardiovascular and thrombotic disorders. Highly significant associations have been described between RDW value and all-cause, non-cardiac and cardiac mortality in patients with coronary artery disease, acute and chronic heart failure, peripheral artery disease, stroke, pulmonary embolism and pulmonary arterial hypertension. It is however still unclear whether anysocytosis might be the cause, or a simple epiphenomenon of an underlying disease, such as inflammation, impaired renal function, undernutrition, oxidative damage, or perhaps an element of both. Nevertheless, RDW is an easy, inexpensive, routinely reported test, whose assessment might allow the acquisition of significant diagnostic and prognostic information in patients with cardiovascular and thrombotic disorders.}

  abstract = {Background: Elevated erythrocyte mean corpuscular volume (MCV) has been suggested to be a risk factor for peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether MCV was associated with a distinct pattern of severe atherosclerosis (lumen reductions {$>$}= 75\%) in patients with symptomatic PAD, as measured by angiography. Patients and methods: 100 consecutively admitted male PAD patients with iliac, femoral-popliteal and crural disease manifestation were compared with 100 male age-matched control subjects without PAD on the basis of angiographically determined lumen reductions {$>$}= 75\%. Results: The pattern of severe atherosclerosis was as follows: 41 PAD patients displayed stenoses/occlusions in the iliac segment, 68 in the femoral-popliteal and 15 in the crural segment. When comparing the PAD patients with the controls by multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis, MCV was an independent predictor of severe atherosclerosis in the iliac (OR = 2.72 for an increment of 5 fl, 95\% CI = 1.15--6.40) and the femoral-popliteal segment (OR = 3.13 for an increment of 5 fl, 95\% CI = 1.51--6.49) but not in the crural site. This pattern was similar to the impact of smoking. Conclusion: Higher MCV values contributed to lumen reductions {$>$}= 75\% of the proximal segments in patients with symptomatic PAD. This observation could be clinically important since revascularisation procedures are done predominantly in these segments. As a consequence, observance of elevated MCV values should be considered in PAD patients.           ,              Hintergrund: Erh{\"o}htes mittleres Erythrozytenvolumen (MCV) ist ein m{\"o}glicher Risikofaktor f{\"u}r die periphere arterielle Verschlusskrankheit (pAVK). Ziel der vorliegenden Studie war es, zu erheben, ob MCV mit einem bestimmten anatomischen Verteilungsmuster von schweren atherosklerotischen Ver{\"a}nderungen (Lumenreduktionen {$>$}= 75\%) bei pAVK-Patienten assoziiert ist. Patienten und Methoden: 100 konsekutiv aufgenommene m{\"a}nnliche Patienten mit symptomatischer pAVK wurden auf der Basis von angiographisch ermittelter Lumenreduktion {$>$}= 75\% im Becken-, Oberschenkel- und Unterschenkelbereich mit 100 altersgematchten Kontrollen ohne pAVK verglichen. Ergebnisse: Das Muster von schweren atherosklerotischen Ver{\"a}nderungen bei den pAVK-Patienten war wie folgt: 41 hatten Stenosen/Verschl{\"u}sse im Beckenbereich, 68 im Oberschenkel- und 15 im Unterschenkelbereich. Beim Vergleich der pAVK-Patienten mit den Kontrollpatienten mittels multivariater logistischer Regressionsanalyse war MCV ein unabh{\"a}ngiger Pr{\"a}diktor f{\"u}r schwere atherosklerotische Ver{\"a}nderungen im Becken- (OR = 2.72 f{\"u}r eine Zunahme von 5 fl, 95\% CI = 1.15--6.40) und im Oberschenkelbereich (OR = 3.13 f{\"u}r eine Zunahme von 5 fl, 95\% CI = 1.51--6.49), aber nicht im Unterschenkelbereich. Dieses Verteilungsmuster entsprach dem Impact des Rauchens. Schlussfolgerung: H{\"o}here MCV-Werte waren mit Lumenreduktionen {$>$}= 75\% in den proximalen Segmenten von pAVK-Patienten assoziiert. Diese Beobachtung k{\"o}nnte klinische Relevanz besitzen, da Revaskulisationen haupts{\"a}chlich in diesen Segmenten durchgef{\"u}hrt werden. Folglich sollte bei pAVK-Patienten auf erh{\"o}hte MCV-Werte geachtet werden.},

  abstract = {Venous thromboembolism (VTE), encompassing deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, is a significant burden on health and economic systems worldwide. Improved VTE management calls for the integration of biomarkers into diagnostic algorithms and scoring systems for risk assessment, possible complications, and mortality. This literature review discusses novel biomarkers with potential diagnostic and prognostic value in personalized VTE management. The pathophysiology of thrombosis starts with cell interactions in the vascular environment and continues with more complex, recently discussed processes such as immunothrombosis and thromboinflammation. Their clinical applicability is in the use of complete blood count (CBC)-derived immuno-inflammatory indices as attractive, readily available biomarkers that reflect pro-thrombotic states. Indices such as the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR = neutrophil count divided by lymphocyte count), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR = platelet count divided by lymphocyte count), and systemic immune-inflammation index (SII = NLR multiplied by platelet count) have demonstrated predictive value for thromboembolic events. Nevertheless, confounding data regarding cutoffs that may be implemented in clinical practice limit their applicability. This literature review aims to investigate neutrophil and platelet interactions as key drivers of immunothrombosis and thromboinflammation while summarizing the relevant research on the corresponding CBC-derived biomarkers, as well as their potential utility in day-to-day clinical practice.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebrovascular white matter (WM) lesions contribute to cognitive impairment and motor dysfunction in the elderly. A disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is believed to be a critical early event leading to these WM lesions. Previous studies have suggested the involvement of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) in BBB disruptions and the upregulation of MMP-2 after chronic cerebral hypoperfusion in a rat model. In the present study, we asked whether MMP-2 is involved in the BBB disruption and the subsequent WM lesions after chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. METHODS: We compared the severity of white matter lesions in rats after chronic cerebral hypoperfusion with or without an MMP inhibitor. Then, we also induced the chronic cerebral hypoperfusion in wild-type and MMP-2-null mice. RESULTS: In the rats treated with a relatively selective MMP-2 inhibitor, AG3340, the WM lesions after chronic cerebral hypoperfusion were significantly less severe, and the number of activated astroglia and microglia were also significantly lower as compared with the vehicle-treated rats. Gene knockout of MMP-2 also reduced the severity of the WM lesions and the number of activated astroglia and microglia in a mice system. In both rodents, the disruption of BBB function, as assessed by IgM staining and the Evans blue extravasation test, was less severe when MMP-2 activity was attenuated. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that MMP-2 plays a critical role in the BBB disruption, glial cell activation, and WM lesions after chronic cerebral hypoperfusion and suggest the potential value of MMP-2 inhibitors as a therapeutic tool in cerebrovascular WM lesions.},

  abstract = {High neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is correlated with the occurrence, morbidity and mortality of cerebrovascular disease as a marker of systemic inflammation. However, its effect on cerebral white matter hyperintensity (WMH) is unclear. We investigated high NLR burden as a surrogate marker of WMH volume in a healthy population. Healthy subjects with voluntary health check-ups between January 2006 and December 2013, including brain MRI and laboratory examination, were collected. WMH volumes were rated quantitatively. A total of 2875 subjects were enrolled, and the mean volume of WMH was 2.63{\textpm}6.26mL. In multivariate linear regression analysis, NLR [{$\beta$}=0.191, 95\% confidence interval (CI)=0.104 to 0.279, P{$<$}0.001] remained significant after adjusting for confounders. Age ({$\beta$}=0.049, 95\% CI=0.045 to 0.054, P{$<$}0.001), hypertension ({$\beta$}=0.191, 95\% CI=0.101 to 0.281, P{$<$}0.001), diabetes ({$\beta$}=0.153, 95\% CI=0.045 to 0.261, P=0.006), and extracranial atherosclerosis ({$\beta$}=0.348, 95\% CI=0.007 to 0.688, P=0.045) were also significant independently from NLR. Additionally, the high NLR group (NLR{$\geq$}1.52) was related to male sex, hypertension, diabetes, current smoking, extracranial atherosclerosis, silent brain infarct, and high WMH volumes. In conclusion, high NLR is associated with larger WMH volumes in a healthy population. Assessment of NLR may be helpful in detecting cerebral WMH burdens in high risk groups.},

Methods and Results---                              Coronary artery segments were obtained at autopsy from 13 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI); 8 had a ruptured and 5 an eroded plaque. Patients (n=45) who had died of noncardiovascular diseases served as reference. Atherectomy specimens were obtained from 35 patients with stable angina pectoris (SAP) and from 32 patients with unstable angina pectoris (UAP). Antibodies against CD66b, elastase, myeloperoxidase, and CD11b identified neutrophils; CD10 identified neutral endopeptidase (NEP). CD66b-positive and NEP-positive neutrophils were counted and expressed as a number per square millimeter of tissue. All specimens with plaque rupture or erosion showed distinct neutrophil infiltration; the number did not differ between ruptured and eroded plaques. However, the number of NEP-positive neutrophils was significantly higher (               P               {$<$}0.0001) in ruptured plaques than in eroded plaques. UAP patients showed neutrophils in 14 of 32 culprit lesions; in SAP only 2 of 35 lesions contained neutrophils. The number of neutrophils and NEP-positive cells in patients with UAP was significantly higher (neutrophils,               P               {$<$}0.0005; NEP-positive cells,               P               {$<$}0.005) than in patients with SAP.                                                          Conclusions---                              The observations suggest that neutrophil infiltration is actively associated with acute coronary events. The high number of NEP-positive neutrophils in ruptured plaques, compared with eroded plaques, may reflect differences in the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.},

Although pathological alteration in small vessels of patients with CSVD can be detected by neuroimaging, diagnosis of CSVD is delayed because it is an asymptomatic disease. The stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHRSP) show similar pathological features to human CSVD and develop stroke-related symptoms with advancing age. Objective: We investigated the time course of haematological parameters in Wistar rats and SHRSP. Material and Methods: Blood cells were analysed using an automated haematological analyser. Results: SHRSP develop stroke-related symptoms including onset of neurological symptoms, decreased body weight and blood brain barrier leakage between 12 and 14 weeks of age. Lymphocyte counts were gradually decreased at 3 weeks before development of stoke-related symptoms and then were further decreased after the development of stroke-related symptoms. The both mean platelet volume and large platelet ratio gradually increased at 3 weeks before the development of stoke-related symptoms. However, although SHRSP showed more microcytic red cells than Wistar rats, the trajectories of change in erythrocyte-related parameters were similar between Wistar rats and SHRSP. Conclusion: Our pilot study suggests that alterations of lymphocyte count and platelet volume predictive indicators for asymptomatic CSVD and symptomatic stroke in SHRSP.},

We found that individuals with AD had significantly lower hemoglobin, mean cell hemoglobin concentrations, packed cell volume and higher erythrocyte sedimentation rates (adjusted for age, gender, APOE-e4 and site). In AD, plasma iron, transferrin, transferrin saturation and red cell folate levels exhibited a significant distortion of their customary relationship to hemoglobin levels. There was a strong association between anemia and AD (adjusted odds ratio (OR)=2.43, confidence interval (CI) (1.31, 4.54)). Moreover, AD emerged as a strong risk factor for anemia on step-down regression, even when controlling for all other available explanations for anemia (adjusted OR=3.41, 95\% CI (1.68, 6.92)). These data indicated that AD is complicated by anemia, which may itself contribute to cognitive decline.},

Within this age group, cardiovascular disease will remain the leading cause of death, and the cost associated with treatment will continue to increase. Aging is an inevitable part of life and unfortunately poses the largest risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Although numerous studies in the cardiovascular field have considered both young and aged humans, there are still many unanswered questions as to how the genetic pathways that regulate aging in model organisms influence cardiovascular aging. Likewise, in the molecular biology of aging field, few studies fully assess the role of these aging pathways in cardiovascular health. Fortunately, this gap is beginning to close, and these two fields are merging together. We provide an overview of some of the key genes involved in regulating lifespan and health span, including sirtuins, AMP-activated protein kinase, mammalian target of rapamycin, and insulin-like growth factor 1 and their roles regulating cardiovascular health. We then discuss a series of review articles that will appear in succession and provide a more comprehensive analysis of studies carried out linking genes of aging and cardiovascular health, and perspectives of future directions of these two intimately linked fields.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between inflammation-based scores and prognosis of patients who had undergone mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for large artery occlusion. METHODS: A total of 411 patients were enrolled and inflammation-based scores, such as neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lymphocyte/monocyte ratio (LMR), and monocyte/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (MHR) were calculated based on laboratory data. Prognoses were evaluated with unfavorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score of 3-6), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, hemorrhagic transformation of infarct, and mortality. Multivariate analyses were performed to explore the relationships of inflammation-based scores with various clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Patients with unfavorable outcome showed higher mean NLR and MHR but lower mean LMR than those with favorable outcome (NLR, 7.32 vs. 3.78, P {$\leq$} 0.001; MHR, 1.42 vs. 1.15, P~= 0.012; LMR, 2.76 vs. 3.70, P~= 0.003). In multivariate analysis, higher NLR ({$\geq$}5.1) (odds ratio [OR], 1.58; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-2.12; P~= 0.014) and higher MHR ({$\geq$}1.4) (OR, 1.32; 95\% CI, 1.10-1.74; P~= 0.028), lower LMR ({$<$}2.5) (OR, 1.28; 95\% CI, 1.08-1.58; P~= 0.032) were independently associated with unfavorable outcome. CONCLUSIONS: After MT, higher NLR, higher MHR, and lower LMR were found in patients with unfavorable outcome. Inflammation-based scores, such as NLR, LMR, and MHR, might be independent factors that can predict outcomes in patients with MT.},

In the past few years, the role of systemic infection and gut dysbiosis in modulating inflammation and stroke risk has been increasingly acknowledged. In this review, we synthesize contemporary literature on the effects of infection and inflammation on stroke risk and outcomes, with a focus on periodontal disease, COVID-19 infection, and gut dysbiosis. RECENT FINDINGS: Chronic and acute infections such as periodontitis and COVID-19 induce systemic inflammation that cause atherogenesis and increase cardiac injury and arrhythmias. These infections also directly injure the endothelium leading to worsened secondary inflammation after stroke. Gut dysbiosis engenders a pro-inflammatory state by modulating intestinal lymphocyte populations that can traffic directly to the brain. Additionally, post-stroke immune dysregulation creates a compounding feedback loop of further infections and gut dysbiosis that worsen outcomes. Recent advances in understanding the pathophysiology of how infection and dysbiosis affect the progression of stroke, as well as long-term recovery, have revealed tantalizing glimpses at potential therapeutic targets. We discuss the multidirectional relationship between stroke, infection, and gut dysbiosis, and identify areas for future research to further explore therapeutic opportunities.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Cerebral perforating arteries provide blood supply to the deep regions of the brain. Recently, it became possible to measure blood flow velocity and pulsatility in these small arteries. It is unknown if vascular risk factors are related to these measures. Methods: We measured perforating artery flow with 2D phase-contrast 7 Tesla MRI at the level of the centrum semiovale (CSO) and the basal ganglia (BG) in seventy participants from the Heart Brain Connection study with carotid occlusive disease (COD), vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), or no actual cerebrovascular disease. Vascular risk factors included hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. Results: No consistent relations were found between any of the vascular risk factors and either flow velocity or flow pulsatility, although there was a relation between lower diastolic blood pressure and higher pulse pressure and higher cerebral perforator pulsatility (p = 0.045 and p = 0.044, respectively) at the BG level. Results were similar in stratified analyses for patients with and without a history of cardiovascular disease, or only COD or VCI. Conclusion: We conclude that, cross-sectionally, cerebral perforating artery flow velocity and pulsatility are largely independent of the presence of common vascular risk factors in a population with a mixed vascular burden.},

DESIGN               : This was an observational study using the Dementia Behavior Disturbance Scale to quantify and define behavioral problems encountered by caregivers. Multiple regressions were used to control for the possible influence of dementia severity as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination and the duration of dementia.                                         SETTING               : Patients were sampled from the outpatient dementia clinics of Roger Williams Hospital and Miriam Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island.                                         PARTICIPANTS               : A total of 125 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease, defined by NINCDS-ADRDA diagnostic criteria, were included in the study. There were 75 women and 50 men.                                         MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES               : Caregivers rated the presence and frequency of 28 different behavior problems from the Dementia Behavior Disturbance Scale. Domains of behavior disturbance were then defined by a factor analysis of the data.                                         RESULTS               : Male and female groups were comparable for the demographic variables of age, education, and duration of dementia, as well as severity of depression, degree of cognitive impairment and overall severity of behavior disturbance. Among the six behavior factors that were defined, two were significantly related to gender. One factor, which included apathy and vegetative signs, was related to male gender; a second factor, which included reclusiveness and emotional lability, was related to female gender.                                         CONCLUSIONS               : Although overall severity of behavior disturbance in Alzheimer's disease may be related primarily to severity of dementia, significant differences in the types of behaviors manifested exist between males and females with the disease.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Nonfocal transient neurological attacks (TNAs) are associated with an increased risk of cardiac events, stroke and dementia. Their etiology is still unknown. Global cerebral hypoperfusion has been suggested to play a role in their etiology, but this has not been investigated. We assessed whether lower total brain perfusion is associated with a higher occurrence of TNAs. Methods: Between 2015 and 2018, patients with heart failure were included in the Heart Brain Connection study. Patients underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging, including quantitative magnetic resonance angiography (QMRA) to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF). We calculated total brain perfusion of each participant by dividing total CBF by brain volume. Patients were interviewed with a standardized questionnaire on the occurrence of TNAs by physicians who were blinded to QMRA flow status. We assessed the relation between total brain perfusion and the occurrence of TNAs with Poisson regression analysis. Results: Of 136 patients (mean age 70 years, 68\% men), 29 (21\%) experienced {$\geq$}1 TNAs. Nonrotatory dizziness was the most common subtype of TNA. Patients with TNAs were more often female and more often had angina pectoris than patients without TNAs, but total CBF and total brain perfusion were not different between both groups. Total brain perfusion was not associated with the occurrence of TNAs (adjusted risk ratio 1.12, 95\% CI 0.88--1.42). Conclusion: We found no association between total brain perfusion and the occurrence of TNAs in patients with heart failure.},

  abstract = {Background and aims Patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy (CEA) still have a residual risk of 13\% of developing a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) within 3 years. Inflammatory processes leading up to MACE are not fully understood. Therefore, we examined blood cell characteristics (BCCs), possibly reflecting inflammatory processes, in relation to MACE to identify BCCs that may contribute to an increased risk. Methods We analyzed 75 pretreatment BCCs from the Sapphire analyzer, and clinical data from the Athero-Express biobank in relation to MACE after CEA using Random Survival Forests, and a Generalized Additive Survival Model. To understand biological mechanisms, we related the identified variables to intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH). Results Of 783 patients, 97 (12\%) developed MACE within 3 years after CEA. Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) (HR 1.23 [1.02, 1.68], p~=~0.022), CV of lymphocyte size (LACV) (HR 0.78 [0.63, 0.99], p~=~0.043), neutrophil complexity of the intracellular structure (NIMN) (HR 0.80 [0.64, 0.98], p~=~0.033), mean neutrophil size (NAMN) (HR 0.67 [0.55, 0.83], p~{$<~$}0.001), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) (HR 1.35 [1.09, 1.66], p~=~0.005), eGFR (HR 0.65 [0.52, 0.80], p~{$<~$}0.001); and HDL-cholesterol (HR 0.62 [0.45, 0.85], p~=~0.003) were related to MACE. NAMN was related to IPH (OR 0.83 [0.71--0.98], p~=~0.02). Conclusions This is the first study to present a higher RDW and MCV and lower LACV, NIMN and NAMN as biomarkers reflecting inflammatory processes that may contribute to an increased risk of MACE after CEA.},

  abstract = {Biological processes underlying decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) are largely unknown. We hypothesized that identification of protein clusters associated with lower CBF in patients with CVD may explain underlying processes. In 428 participants (74\% cardiovascular diseases; 26\% reference participants) from the Heart-Brain Connection Study, we assessed the relationship between 92 plasma proteins from the Olink{\textregistered} cardiovascular III panel and normal-appearing grey matter CBF, using affinity propagation and hierarchical clustering algorithms, and generated a Biomarker Compound Score (BCS). The BCS was related to cardiovascular risk and observed cardiovascular events within 2-year follow-up using Spearman correlation and logistic regression. Thirteen proteins were associated with CBF ({$\rho$}               Spearman               range: -0.10 to -0.19, p               FDR-corrected               {$<$}0.05), and formed one cluster. The cluster primarily reflected extracellular matrix organization processes. The BCS was higher in patients with CVD compared to reference participants (p               FDR-corrected               {$<$}0.05) and was associated with cardiovascular risk ({$\rho$}               Spearman               0.42, p\,{$<$}\,0.001) and cardiovascular events (OR 2.05, p\,{$<$}\,0.01). In conclusion, we identified a cluster of plasma proteins related to CBF, reflecting extracellular matrix organization processes, that is also related to future cardiovascular events in patients with CVD, representing potential targets to preserve CBF and mitigate cardiovascular risk in patients with CVD.},

  abstract = {Background               Exclusion of coronary stenosis in individuals with suggestive symptoms is challenging. Cardiac CT or coronary angiography is often used but is inefficient and costly and involves risks. Sex-stratified algorithms based on electronic health records (EHRs) could be a non-invasive alternative for excluding coronary stenosis, yet their performance may vary by healthcare settings. Thus, external validation is crucial for determining their generalisability. This study aimed to externally validate sex-stratified machine learning algorithms based on EHR data to predict the absence of coronary stenosis, evaluated in diverse clinical settings.                                         Methods               Sex-stratified XGBoost algorithms were trained on EHR data from patients who underwent coronary imaging at the University Medical Center Utrecht (n=14 674) and externally tested on EHR data of 13 Cardiology centres in the Netherlands (n=9252). The outcome was defined as the absence of coronary stenosis, identified through text mining of radiology report conclusions, and predictive performance was assessed by negative predictive values (NPVs) and specificities.                                         Results               On the training cohort (9298 men (median age 55 years, 73\% no coronary stenosis) and 5376 women (median age 59 years, 83\% no coronary stenosis)), the algorithms showed NPVs and specificities of 0.95 and 0.14 in men and 0.93 and 0.26 in women, respectively. On the testing cohort (4762 men (median age 60 years, 60\% no coronary stenosis) and 4490 women (median age 60 years, 83\% no coronary stenosis)), the algorithm showed NPVs and specificities of 0.89 and 0.07 in men and 0.87 and 0.18 in women, respectively.                                         Conclusions               This study externally validates sex-stratified machine learning algorithms using EHR data to non-invasively predict the absence of coronary stenosis, with high NPVs observed across settings. However, given the modest specificity and study limitations, these findings should be considered preliminary, warranting further refinement before clinical adoption.},

Sex-specific BCCs related to recanalization success varied and were linked to stroke etiology. This enhanced understanding may facilitate personalized treatment for acute ischemic stroke.},

  abstract = {Electronic health records (EHRs) contain valuable data for reuse in science, quality evaluations, and clinical decision support. Because routinely obtained laboratory data are abundantly present, often numeric, generated by certified laboratories, and stored in a structured way, one may assume that they are immediately fit for (re)use in research. However, behind each test result lies an extensive context of choices and considerations, made by both humans and machines, that introduces hidden patterns in the data. If they are unaware, researchers reusing routine laboratory data may eventually draw incorrect conclusions. In this paper, after discussing health care system characteristics on both the macro and micro level, we introduce the reader to hidden aspects of generating structured routine laboratory data in 4 steps (ordering, preanalysis, analysis, and postanalysis) and explain how each of these steps may interfere with the reuse of routine laboratory data. As researchers reusing these data, we underline the importance of domain knowledge of the health care professional, laboratory specialist, data manager, and patient to turn routine laboratory data into meaningful data sets to help obtain relevant insights that create value for clinical care.},

  abstract = {Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems is a complete and accessible account of the theoretical foundations and computational methods that underlie plausible reasoning under uncertainty. The author provides a coherent explication of probability as a language for reasoning with partial belief and offers a unifying perspective on other AI approaches to uncertainty, such as the Dempster-Shafer formalism, truth maintenance systems, and nonmonotonic logic. The author distinguishes syntactic and semantic approaches to uncertainty--and offers techniques, based on belief networks, that provide a mechanism for making semantics-based systems operational. Specifically, network-propagation techniques serve as a mechanism for combining the theoretical coherence of probability theory with modern demands of reasoning-systems technology: modular declarative inputs, conceptually meaningful inferences, and parallel distributed computation. Application areas include diagnosis, forecasting, image interpretation, multi-sensor fusion, decision support systems, plan recognition, planning, speech recognition--in short, almost every task requiring that conclusions be drawn from uncertain clues and incomplete information. Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems will be of special interest to scholars and researchers in AI, decision theory, statistics, logic, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and the management sciences. Professionals in the areas of knowledge-based systems, operations research, engineering, and statistics will find theoretical and computational tools of immediate practical use. The book can also be used as an excellent text for graduate-level courses in AI, operations research, or applied probability.},

Methods               A total of 153 consecutive patients with acute stroke following MT, in two separate stroke centers, were enrolled between May 2013 and March 2016. MPV was measured on admission. Subjects were divided into two groups according to average MPV level. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. MPV was also incorporated into the Houston IA Therapy (HIAT) score, which was developed as a scoring system to predict poor prognosis, and the prediction capability was compared with the HIAT score alone.                                         Results               The average MPV was 10.4\>fL. Patients with high MPV had a significantly lower rate of functional independence (28.9\% vs 57.1\%, p=0.000). After multivariable analysis, elevated MPV remained an independent predictor of unfavorable outcome (OR=3.93, 95\% CI 1.73 to 8.94, p=0.001). When the MPV cut-off value was set at 10.4\>fL using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, MPV {$\geq$}10.4\>fL predicted unfavorable outcome with 62.1\% sensitivity and 66.7\% specificity, respectively. Addition of MPV to the HIAT score did not improve predictive power compared with the HIAT score system alone by a comparison of the areas under the two ROC curves (0.70 vs 0.62, p=0.174).

  abstract = {Background and Purpose---               Mechanical thrombectomy using stent retriever devices have been advocated to increase revascularization in intracranial vessel occlusion. We present the results of a large prospective study on the use of the Solitaire Flow Restoration in patients with acute ischemic stroke.                                         Methods---               Solitaire Flow Restoration Thrombectomy for Acute Revascularization was an international, multicenter, prospective, single-arm study of Solitaire Flow Restoration thrombectomy in patients with large vessel anterior circulation strokes treated within 8 hours of symptom onset. Strict criteria for site selection were applied. The primary end point was the revascularization rate (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction {$\geq$}2b) of the occluded vessel as determined by an independent core laboratory. The secondary end point was the rate of good functional outcome (defined as 90-day modified Rankin scale, 0--2).                                         Results---               A total of 202 patients were enrolled across 14 comprehensive stroke centers in Europe, Canada, and Australia. The median age was 72 years, 60\% were female patients. The median National Institute of Health Stroke Scale was 17. Most proximal intracranial occlusion was the internal carotid artery in 18\%, and the middle cerebral artery in 82\%. Successful revascularization was achieved in 79.2\% of patients. Device and procedure-related severe adverse events were found in 7.4\%. Favorable neurological outcome was found in 57.9\%. The mortality rate was 6.9\%. Any intracranial hemorrhagic transformation was found in 18.8\% of patients, 1.5\% were symptomatic.                                         Conclusions---               In this single-arm study, treatment with the Solitaire Flow Restoration device in intracranial anterior circulation occlusions results in high rates of revascularization, low risk of clinically relevant procedural complications, and good clinical outcomes in combination with low mortality at 90 days.

It is a compromise between the usual discriminant analysis and a discriminant analysis on the significant principal components of the predictor variables. This technique is specially suited to deal with a much larger number of predictors than observations and with multicollineality, two of the main problems encountered when analysing microarray expression data. We explore the performance of PLS-DA with published data from breast cancer (Perou et al. 2000). Several such analyses were carried out: (1) before vs after chemotherapy treatment, (2) estrogen receptor positive vs negative tumours, and (3) tumour classification. We found that the performance of PLS-DA was extremely satisfactory in all cases and that the discriminant cDNA clones often had a sound biological interpretation. We conclude that PLS-DA is a powerful yet simple tool for analysing microarray data.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Acute coronary syndromes can be initiated by either atherosclerotic fibrous cap ruptures, superficial plaque erosions or intraplaque haemorrhages (IPHs). Since neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) display pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic properties, we investigated the presence, extent and distribution of neutrophils and NETs in different types of plaque complications in relation to the age of overlying thrombus mass or haemorrhage. Sixty-four paraffin-embedded coronary plaque segments of 30 acute myocardial infarction patients were retrieved from the autopsy archives, which contained 44 complicated plaques (17 IPHs, 9 erosions and 18 ruptures) and 20 intact plaques. Complicated plaques were further categorized according to the histological age of thrombus or haemorrhage. Immunohistochemistry was performed to visualize neutrophils (anti-myeloperoxidase, anti-elastase and anti-CD177) and NETs (anti-citrullinated histone-3 and anti-peptidyl-arginine-deiminase-4). The results were scored semi-quantitatively. Neutrophils and NETs were abundantly present in all types of complicated, but not in intact, plaques (p\,{$<$}\,0.05). They were found in thrombus, haemorrhages and at the thrombus--plaque interface, with no significant differences in extent between ruptures, erosions and IPHs. Interestingly, adjacent perivascular tissue of complicated, but not of intact plaques, also contained high numbers of neutrophils and NETs (p\,{$<$}\,0.05). In thrombus and haemorrhage of different age, neutrophils and NETs were more frequently present in non-organized (fresh) thrombi and in on-going IPHs. In conclusion, netosis is a prominent pro-thrombotic participant in all distinct types of atherothrombosis, which may facilitate the progression of thrombotic or haemorrhagic complications and thus the onset of ensuing clinical coronary ischemic syndromes.},

Cardiac syndrome X is defined by the presence of angina-like chest pain, a positive response to stress testing and angiographically normal coronary arteriogram. It has been shown to occur in approximately 20 - 30 percent of angina patients undergoing cardiac catheterization. Most of the patients with normal angiograms are women especially in perimenopausal age. Syndrome X patients reported more depression, anxiety and somatic concerns than positive angiographic patients. They have high scores on psychological inventories that measure anxiety and depression, and are very prone to somatization. They have better prognosis with death from cardiac causes than patients with coronary heart disease. With regard to female chest pain patients, somatoform disorder can be assumed. At the present time, there is no common agreement on the exact cause of the symptoms associated with syndrome X.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is a devastating problem. Overall, the mortality rate associated with aSAH is 32\% to 67\%, which makes it the most lethal type of hemorrhagic stroke. Once the aneurysm has been treated, cerebral vasospasm is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality associated with aSAH. Thus, ability to effectively prevent or treat cerebral vasospasm could result in significantly improved survival and quality of life for aSAH patients. Unfortunately, partly because of poor understanding of the mechanisms of vasospasm, current diagnosis and treatment can be inconsistent and/or ineffective. Current treatment methods include primarily medical therapy and endovascular methods. Alone, or in combination, these measures can be of benefit in some patients. However, they are not uniformly efficacious and, on an individual basis, they can present significant risks. These risks include stroke, cardiovascular compromise, and death. More effective diagnosis and treatment strategies could significantly improve patient outcomes after aSAH. Unfortunately, clinically reliable biomarker for cerebral vasospasm has yet to be identified. Biomarker discovery may facilitate earlier diagnosis of vasospasm and improved monitoring of the response to treatment. It may help in stratifying patients into categories of risk to develop vasospasm, which could subsequently guide therapy. Indeed, biomarker research may suggest "vasospasm phenotypes" that can be used to guide the most effective type of therapy for that particular patient. The purpose of this manuscript is to review the current cerebral vasospasm biomarker literature. METHODS: An extensive PubMed literature search was performed. We identified over 100 English language articles with key words cerebral vasospasm and biomarkers. Some of these articles and related references were used as the basis of this review. We focused on related human studies performed within the past 10 years. RESULTS: In this review, we focus on recent work identifying molecular markers of cerebral vasospasm following aSAH and the current understanding of the utility of these markers. We highlight novel approaches such as the use of cellular microparticles for the evaluation of cerebral vasospasm. CONCLUSIONS: Although multiple molecules have been proposed, no single molecule has been shown to be a clinically reliable biomarker for cerebral vasospasm. This is not surprising based on the complex pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm. Indeed, it is unlikely that a single biomarker will be clinically effective and reliable for predicting cerebral vasospasm. Instead, cerebral vasospasm may be best predicted by a panel of markers and the temporal progression of their relative levels after aSAH. Many such candidate molecules are reviewed herein and can be categorized as markers of cell damage, inflammation, changes in metabolism and vascular tone as well as microparticle-derived biomarkers. Among these, microparticle-derived biomarkers seem to be promising and lend themselves to further study. Biomarker discovery may facilitate earlier diagnosis of vasospasm and improved monitoring of the response to treatment. Ultimately, it may guide in the development of safer and more effective therapies for the most dreaded of aSAH complications.},

  abstract = {Background: White matter damage is closely associated with cognitive and psychiatric symptoms and is prevalent in cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD); although the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in CSVD remain elusive, inflammation plays a crucial role. We sought to investigate the relationship between systemic inflammation markers and imaging markers of CVSD, namely white matter hyperintensity (WMH) and microstructural injury. Methods: We conducted a study involving both cross-sectional and longitudinal data from the UK Biobank Cohort. We performed multiple linear regression analyses, adjusted for potential confounders, to explore the associations between systemic inflammation markers (e.g., systemic immune--inflammation index [SII], neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio [NLR], C-reactive protein [CRP] levels, monocyte count, neutrophil count) and macro- and microstructural white matter injury, as markers of CSVD. We performed Mendelian randomization analysis to investigate the genetically predictive effect of monocytes on WMH, as well as mediation analysis to clarify whether inflammatory markers affected cognitive function via white matter injury. Results: We included 36 411 participants (mean age 54.8 {\textpm} 7.5 yr, 51.9\% female) from the UK Biobank Cohort. We found that SII was significantly associated with both WMH and microstructural injury markers (fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, intracellular volume fraction, and isotropic compartment volume fraction [ISOVF]), and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was significantly associated with WMH and some markers of microstructural injury (mean diffusivity and ISOVF). Our analysis revealed that the CRP level was significantly associated with WMH and WMH progression but not with microstructural injury. We also demonstrated that monocyte count was significantly associated with WMH and ISOVF, and that neutrophil count was significantly associated with WMH, mean diffusivity, and ISOVF. In 2-sample Mendelian randomization analyses, we found positive associations between genetic determinants of monocytes and WMH. The mediating role of WMH suggested that a higher SII value and monocyte count could contribute to cognitive impairment through white matter injury. Limitations: Although the study includes both cross-sectional and longitudinal components, the sample size for the longitudinal aspect is limited, and the use of blood biomarkers from a single timepoint is also a limitation of this research. Conclusion: The SII and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio may be early detection markers for white matter damage in patients with CSVD, whereas the CRP level is more closely associated with disease severity and progression. Our findings highlight the clinical relevance of systemic inflammation markers with white matter macro- and microstructural injuries, revealing that systemic inflammation is likely involved in the mechanism of early white matter injury among patients with CSVD.},

  abstract = {AIMS: Superficial erosion of atheromata causes many acute coronary syndromes, but arises from unknown mechanisms. This study tested the hypothesis that Toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2) activation contributes to endothelial apoptosis and denudation and thus contributes to the pathogenesis of superficial erosion. METHODS AND RESULTS: Toll-like receptor-2 and neutrophils localized at sites of superficially eroded human plaques. In vitro, TLR2 ligands (including hyaluronan, a matrix macromolecule abundant in eroded lesions) induced endothelial stress, characterized by reactive oxygen species production, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and apoptosis. Co-incubation of neutrophils with endothelial cells (ECs) potentiated these effects and induced EC apoptosis and detachment. We then categorized human atherosclerotic plaques (n = 56) based on morphologic features associated with superficial erosion, 'stable' fibrotic, or 'vulnerable' lesions. Morphometric analyses of the human atheromata localized neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) near clusters of apoptotic ECs in smooth muscle cell (SMC)-rich plaques. The number of luminal apoptotic ECs correlated with neutrophil accumulation, amount of NETs, and TLR2 staining in SMC-rich plaques, but not in 'vulnerable' atheromata. CONCLUSION: These in vitro observations and analyses of human plaques indicate that TLR2 stimulation followed by neutrophil participation may render smooth muscle cell-rich plaques susceptible to superficial erosion and thrombotic complications by inducing ER stress, apoptosis, and favouring detachment of EC.},

  abstract = {The spectrum of mixed brain pathologies expands beyond accompanying vascular pathology in brains with Alzheimer's disease-related pathology. Co-occurrence of neurodegenerative non-Alzheimer's disease-type proteinopathies is increasingly recognized to be a frequent event in the brains of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, particularly in older people. Owing to the evolving concept of neurodegenerative diseases, clinical and neuropathological diagnostic criteria have changed during the last decades. Autopsy-based studies differ in the selection criteria and also in the applied staining methods used. The present review summarizes the prevalence of mixed brain pathologies reported in recent community-based studies. In these cohorts, irrespective of the clinical symptoms, the frequency of Alzheimer's disease-related pathology is between 19 and 67\%, of Lewy body pathology is between 6 and 39\%, of vascular pathologies is between 28 and 70\%, of TDP-43 proteinopathy is between 13 and 46\%, of hippocampal sclerosis is between 3 and 13\% and, finally, of mixed pathologies is between 10 and 74\%. Some studies also mention tauopathies. White-matter pathologies are not discussed specifically in all studies, although these lesions may be present in more than 80\% of the aging brains. In summary, community-based neuropathology studies have shown that complex constellations of underlying pathologies may lead to cognitive decline, and that the number of possible combinations increases in the aging brain. These observations have implications for the prediction of the prognosis, for the development of biomarkers or therapy targets, or for the stratification of patient cohorts for genome-wide studies or, eventually, for therapy trials.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chest pain in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) is common in women; it is frequently associated with debilitating symptoms and repeated evaluations and may be caused by coronary microvascular dysfunction. However, the prevalence and determinants of microvascular dysfunction in these women are uncertain. METHODS: We measured coronary flow velocity reserve (coronary velocity response to intracoronary adenosine) to evaluate the coronary microvasculature and risk factors for atherosclerosis in 159 women (mean age, 52.9 years) with chest pain and no obstructive CAD. All women were referred for coronary angiography to evaluate their chest pain as part of the Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation (WISE) study. RESULTS: Seventy-four (47\%) women had subnormal ({$<$}2.5) coronary flow velocity reserve suggestive of microvascular dysfunction (mean, 2.02 +/- 0.38); 85 (53\%) had normal reserve (mean, 3.13 +/- 0.64). Demographic characteristics, blood pressure, ventricular function, lipid levels, and reproductive hormone levels were not significantly different between women with normal and those with abnormal microvascular function. Postmenopausal hormone use within 3 months was significantly less prevalent among those with microvascular dysfunction (40\% vs 60\%, P =.032). Age and number of years past menopause correlated with flow velocity reserve (r = -0.18, P =.02, and r = -0.30, P {$<$}.001, respectively). No significant associations were identified between flow velocity reserve and lipid and hormone levels, blood pressure, and left ventricular ejection fraction. CONCLUSIONS: Coronary microvascular dysfunction is present in approximately one half of women with chest pain in the absence of obstructive CAD and cannot be predicted by risk factors for atherosclerosis and hormone levels. Therefore, the diagnosis of coronary microvascular dysfunction should be considered in women with chest pain not attributable to obstructive CAD.},

It is commonly suggested that more than 50\% of patients with coronary heart disease lack any of the conventional risk factors. OBJECTIVE. To determine the prevalence of four conventional risk factors among patients with coronary heart disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS. We analyzed data of 606 patients with coronary heart disease (myocardial infarction, unstable and stable angina pectoris) hospitalized in the Clinics of Santariskes, Vilnius University Hospital, in 1997-2005. RESULTS. Among patients with coronary heart disease, at least one of four conventional risk factors was present in 98\% of patients. Hypertension was present in 47.7\% of patients, diabetes - in 12.9\%, dyslipidemia - 90.1\%, and smoking - in 24.1\% of patients. In younger patients ({$<$}55 years), only 2.3\% of patients lacked any of four conventional risk factors. Two-thirds (66.5\%) of younger patients with coronary heart disease had two and more risk factors. CONCLUSIONS. Considering the fact that patients with coronary heart disease often lack conventional risk factors, currently more attention is given to nontraditional risk factors as well as genetic causes of coronary heart disease. Nevertheless, the present study revealed that 98\% of patients with coronary heart disease had at least one of four conventional risk factors. Among younger patients (younger than 55 years), conventional risk factors are identified very frequently. Thus, it can be concluded that in order to reduce the epidemic of coronary heart disease, much greater emphasis should be given to identify and to improve prevention of four conventional risk factors as well as the lifestyle of the patient.},

First, the number of platelets should be estimated in order to confirm the platelet count determined by the haematology analyser, and to rule out causes of spuriously low or elevated platelet counts. Second, the size and morphological features of the platelets, which may provide information on the underlying cause of the low or enhanced platelet count, have to be assessed.                                         Content               This review summarizes the physiological and pathological features of platelet size and morphology, circulating megakaryocytes, micromegakaryocytes and megakaryoblasts, and provides an overview of current guidelines on the reporting of platelet morphology.                                         Summary               In the diagnostic work-up of a patient with thrombocytopenia, the size of the platelets is of diagnostic relevance. Thrombocytopenia with small platelets is suggestive of a defect in platelet production, whereas the presence of large platelets is more likely to be associated with enhanced platelet turnover or hereditary thrombocytopenias. Morphological platelet abnormalities may affect the granulation and the shape and are frequently associated with abnormalities of platelet size. Platelet anomalies can be found in various haematologic disorders, such as myelodysplastic syndromes, myeloproliferative neoplasms, acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia or hereditary thrombocytopenias.},

This study was performed to explore the interrelationships between homocysteine, B vitamins, and vascular diseases and to evaluate the role of these vitamins as risk factors for atherosclerosis. METHODS: In a multicenter case-control study in Europe, 750 patients with documented vascular disease and 800 control subjects frequency-matched for age and sex were compared. Plasma levels of total homocysteine (before and after methionine loading) were determined, as were those of red cell folate, vitamin B12, and vitamin B6. RESULTS: In a conditional logistic regression model, homocysteine concentrations greater than the 80th percentile for control subjects either fasting (12.1 micromol/L) or after a methionine load (38.0 micromol/L) were associated with an elevated risk of vascular disease independent of all traditional risk factors. In addition, concentrations of red cell folate below the lowest 10th percentile ({$<$}513 nmol/L) and concentrations of vitamin B6 below the lowest 20th percentile ({$<$}23.3 nmol/L) for control subjects were also associated with increased risk. This risk was independent of conventional risk factors and for folate was explained in part by increased homocysteine levels. In contrast, the relationship between vitamin B6 and atherosclerosis was independent of homocysteine levels both before and after methionine loading. CONCLUSIONS: Lower levels of folate and vitamin B6 confer an increased risk of atherosclerosis. Clinical trials are now required to evaluate the effect of treatment with these vitamins in the primary and secondary prevention of vascular diseases.},

The purpose of this study was to analyze possible sex differences in patients suffering first-ever acute stroke. METHODS: From December 1995 to January 2002, 1581 patients with first-ever acute stroke were analyzed, taking into account sex, age, risk factors, clinical presentation, stroke subtype, treatment, and outcome data. RESULTS: Mean age was higher in women than in men (P{$<$}0.001). Hypertension (P=0.0027) and cardioembolic disease (P=0.0035) were independent factors related to women. Alcohol overuse (P{$<$}0.001), smoking (P{$<$}0.001), and vascular peripheral disease (P=0.031) were related to the male sex. Women more often suffered aphasic disorders (P{$<$}0.001), visual field disturbances (P{$<$}0.05), and dysphagia (P{$<$}0.01) than men. There were no differences in hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes according to sex. Women suffered more cardioembolic strokes (P{$<$}0.001); men suffered more atherothrombotic (P{$<$}0.001) and lacunar strokes (P{$<$}0.05). Women who survived remained more disabled than men (P{$<$}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Sex determines some clear differences in patients suffering a first-ever stroke. Women were, on average, 6 years older than men and had a different profile of vascular risk factors and a different distribution of stroke subtypes. Women had a longer hospital stay and remained more disabled than men. The amelioration of hypertension control and increase in anticoagulant treatment in patients with atrial fibrillation would be the best options for preventing stroke, especially in women.},

Results---                              Mean age was higher in women than in men (               P               {$<$}0.001). Hypertension (               P               =0.0027) and cardioembolic disease (               P               =0.0035) were independent factors related to women. Alcohol overuse (               P               {$<$}0.001), smoking (               P               {$<$}0.001), and vascular peripheral disease (               P               =0.031) were related to the male sex. Women more often suffered aphasic disorders (               P               {$<$}0.001), visual field disturbances (               P               {$<$}0.05), and dysphagia (               P               {$<$}0.01) than men. There were no differences in hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes according to sex. Women suffered more cardioembolic strokes (               P               {$<$}0.001); men suffered more atherothrombotic (               P               {$<$}0.001) and lacunar strokes (               P               {$<$}0.05). Women who survived remained more disabled than men (               P               {$<$}0.001).                                                          Conclusions---                              Sex determines some clear differences in patients suffering a first-ever stroke. Women were, on average, 6 years older than men and had a different profile of vascular risk factors and a different distribution of stroke subtypes. Women had a longer hospital stay and remained more disabled than men. The amelioration of hypertension control and increase in anticoagulant treatment in patients with atrial fibrillation would be the best options for preventing stroke, especially in women.},

  abstract = {Background               Stroke is among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Without reliable prediction models and outcome measurements, comparison of care systems is impossible. We analyzed prospectively collected data from 4 countries to explore the importance of stroke severity in outcome prediction.                                         Methods and Results               For 2~months, all acute ischemic stroke patients from the hospitals participating in the Global Comparators Stroke GOAL (Global Outcomes Accelerated Learning) collaboration received a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score on admission and a modified Rankin Scale score at 30 and 90~days. These data were added to the administrative data set, and risk prediction models including age, sex, comorbidity index, and NIHSS were derived for in-hospital death within 7~days, all in-hospital death, and death and good outcome at 30 and 90~days. The relative importance of each variable was assessed using the proportion of explained variation. Of 1034 admissions for acute ischemic stroke, 614 had a full set of NIHSS and both modified Rankin Scale values recorded; of these, 507 patients could be linked to administrative data. The marginal proportion of explained variation was 0.7\% to 4.0\% for comorbidity index, and 11.3 to 25.0 for NIHSS score. The percentage explained by the model varied by outcome (16.6--29.1\%) and was highest for good outcome at 30 and 90~days. There was high agreement between 30- and 90-day modified Rankin Scale scores (weighted {$\kappa$}=0.82).                                         Conclusions               In this prospective pilot study, the baseline NIHSS score was essential for prediction of acute ischemic stroke outcomes, followed by age; whereas traditional comorbidity index contributed little to the overall model. Future studies of stroke outcomes between different care systems will benefit from including a baseline NIHSS score.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine if electron beam computed tomography (EBCT) has potential as a cost-effective approach to diagnosis of obstructive coronary disease. BACKGROUND: Coronary calcification quantified by EBCT is closely related to the extent of atherosclerosis. METHODS: A model based upon published sensitivities (Se)/specificities (Sp) for diagnosis in an ambulatory patient of obstructive coronary disease ({$>$} or =50\% stenosis) and population prevalence was tested for angiography alone, or treadmill exercise, stress echocardiography, stress thallium or predetermined EBCT calcium score outpoints, followed by angiography if indicated. RESULTS: Total direct testing costs increased in proportion to disease prevalence whereas cost-effectiveness, direct costs/patient diagnosed correctly with disease, decreased as a function of prevalence. Using an EBCT calcium score of 168 (Se/Sp = 71\%/90\%) provided for the least costly and most cost-effective noninvasive pathway. Calcium scores of 80 (Se/Sp = 84\%/84\%) and 37 (Se/Sp = 90\%/77\%) were also cost-effective when prevalence of disease was {$<$} or =70\%; but results for a {$>$}0 calcium score (Se/Sp = 95\%/46\%) cutpoint were not superior to conventional methods. Calcium score cutpoints of 37, 80 or 168 provided similar or superior overall negative and positive predictive values to conventional noninvasive testing pathways across all prevalence subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: In ambulatory patients evaluated for obstructive coronary disease, a testing pathway utilizing quantification of coronary calcium by EBCT as an initial noninvasive testing approach minimized direct costs, and maximized cost-effectiveness in population groups with low/ moderate disease prevalence ({$<$} or =70\%); as expected, direct angiography as the first and only test proved most cost-effective in patients with a high prevalence ({$>$}70\%) of disease.},

  abstract = {Background and Objectives: In survival analysis, using the Cox model to determine the effective factors requires the assumptions whose failure of leads to biased results. The aim of this paper was to determine the factors affecting the survival of metastatic gastric cancer patients using the non-parametric method of Randomized Survival Forest (RSF) model and to compare its result with the Cox model. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, 201 patients with metastatic gastric cancer were evaluated in Hamadan Province. Patient survival was calculated from diagnosis to death or end of study. Demographic characteristics (such as gender and age) and clinical variables (including stage, tumor size, etc.) were extracted from the patient records. Factors affecting survival were determined using the Cox model and RSF. Data analysis was performed using the R3.4.3 software and RandomForestSRC and survival packages. Results: The mean (SD) age of patients was 61.5 (12.9) years old. The Cox model showed that chemotherapy (p=0.033) was effective in survival, and the results of fitting the RSF model showed that the most important variables affecting survival were type of surgery, location of metastasis, chemotherapy, age, tumor grade, surgery, number of involved lymph nodes, sex and radiotherapy. Based on the model appropriateness, the RSF model with log-rank split rule had a better performance compared to the Cox model. Conclusion: If the number of variables is high and there is a relationship between the variables, the RSF method identifies the important and effective variables on survival with high accuracy without requiring restrictive assumptions compared to the Cox model.}

  abstract = {AIMS: Heart failure (HF) is frequently caused by an ischaemic event (e.g. myocardial infarction) but might also be caused by a primary disease of the myocardium (cardiomyopathy). In order to identify targeted therapies specific for either ischaemic or non-ischaemic HF, it is important to better understand differences in underlying molecular mechanisms. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a biological physical protein-protein interaction network analysis to identify pathophysiological pathways distinguishing ischaemic from non-ischaemic HF. First, differentially expressed plasma protein biomarkers were identified in 1160 patients enrolled in the BIOSTAT-CHF study, 715 of whom had ischaemic HF and 445 had non-ischaemic HF. Second, we constructed an enriched physical protein-protein interaction network, followed by a pathway over-representation analysis. Finally, we identified key network proteins. Data were validated in an independent HF cohort comprised of 765 ischaemic and 100 non-ischaemic HF patients. We found 21/92 proteins to be up-regulated and 2/92 down-regulated in ischaemic relative to non-ischaemic HF patients. An enriched network of 18 proteins that were specific for ischaemic heart disease yielded six pathways, which are related to inflammation, endothelial dysfunction superoxide production, coagulation, and atherosclerosis. We identified five key network proteins: acid phosphatase 5, epidermal growth factor receptor, insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1, plasminogen activator urokinase receptor, and secreted phosphoprotein 1. Similar results were observed in the independent validation cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Pathophysiological pathways distinguishing patients with ischaemic HF from those with non-ischaemic HF were related to inflammation, endothelial dysfunction superoxide production, coagulation, and atherosclerosis. The five key pathway proteins identified are potential treatment targets specifically for patients with ischaemic HF.},

  abstract = {Background:               A systemic proinflammatory state has been hypothesized to mediate the association between comorbidities and abnormal cardiac structure/function in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). We conducted a proteomic analysis to investigate this paradigm.                                         Methods:               In 228 patients with HFpEF from the multicenter PROMIS-HFpEF study (Prevalence of Microvascular Dysfunction in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction), 248 unique circulating proteins were quantified by a multiplex immunoassay (Olink) and used to recapitulate systemic inflammation. In a deductive approach, we performed principal component analysis to summarize 47 proteins known a priori to be involved in inflammation. In an inductive approach, we performed unbiased weighted coexpression network analyses of all 248 proteins to identify clusters of proteins that overrepresented inflammatory pathways. We defined comorbidity burden as the sum of 8 common HFpEF comorbidities. We used multivariable linear regression and statistical mediation analyses to determine whether and to what extent inflammation mediates the association of comorbidity burden with abnormal cardiac structure/function in HFpEF. We also externally validated our findings in an independent cohort of 117 HFpEF cases and 30 comorbidity controls without heart failure.                                         Results:                                Comorbidity burden was associated with abnormal cardiac structure/function and with principal components/clusters of inflammation proteins. Systemic inflammation was also associated with increased mitral E velocity, E/e{$\prime$} ratio, and tricuspid regurgitation velocity; and worse right ventricular function (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion and right ventricular free wall strain). Inflammation mediated the association between comorbidity burden and mitral E velocity (proportion mediated 19\%--35\%), E/e{$\prime$} ratio (18\%--29\%), tricuspid regurgitation velocity (27\%--41\%), and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (13\%) (                 P                 {$<$}0.05 for all), but not right ventricular free wall strain. TNFR1 (tumor necrosis factor receptor 1), UPAR (urokinase plasminogen activator receptor), IGFBP7 (insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7), and GDF-15 (growth differentiation factor-15) were the top individual proteins that mediated the relationship between comorbidity burden and echocardiographic parameters. In the validation cohort, inflammation was upregulated in HFpEF cases versus controls, and the most prominent inflammation protein cluster identified in PROMIS-HFpEF was also present in HFpEF cases (but not controls) in the validation cohort.                                                        Conclusions:               Proteins involved in inflammation form a conserved network in HFpEF across 2 independent cohorts and may mediate the association between comorbidity burden and echocardiographic indicators of worse hemodynamics and right ventricular dysfunction. These findings support the comorbidity-inflammation paradigm in HFpEF.},

  abstract = {Importance               Vascular disease is a treatable contributor to dementia risk, but the role of specific markers remains unclear, making prevention strategies uncertain.                                         Objective               To investigate the causal association between white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden, clinical stroke, blood pressure (BP), and dementia risk, while accounting for potential epidemiologic biases.                                         Design, Setting, and Participants               This study first examined the association of genetically determined WMH burden, stroke, and BP levels with Alzheimer disease (AD) in a 2-sample mendelian randomization (2SMR) framework. Second, using population-based studies (1979-2018) with prospective dementia surveillance, the genetic association of WMH, stroke, and BP with incident all-cause dementia was examined. Data analysis was performed from July 26, 2020, through July 24, 2022.                                         Exposures               Genetically determined WMH burden and BP levels, as well as genetic liability to stroke derived from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in European ancestry populations.                                         Main Outcomes and Measures               The association of genetic instruments for WMH, stroke, and BP with dementia was studied using GWASs of AD (defined clinically and additionally meta-analyzed including both clinically diagnosed AD and AD defined based on parental history [AD-meta]) for 2SMR and incident all-cause dementia for longitudinal analyses.                                         Results                                In 2SMR (summary statistics--based) analyses using AD GWASs with up to 75\,024 AD cases (mean [SD] age at AD onset, 75.5 [4.4] years; 56.9\% women), larger WMH burden showed evidence for a causal association with increased risk of AD (odds ratio [OR], 1.43; 95\% CI, 1.10-1.86;                 P                 \,=\,.007, per unit increase in WMH risk alleles) and AD-meta (OR, 1.19; 95\% CI, 1.06-1.34;                 P                 \,=\,.008), after accounting for pulse pressure for the former. Blood pressure traits showed evidence for a protective association with AD, with evidence for confounding by shared genetic instruments. In the longitudinal (individual-level data) analyses involving 10\,699 incident all-cause dementia cases (mean [SD] age at dementia diagnosis, 74.4 [9.1] years; 55.4\% women), no significant association was observed between larger WMH burden and incident all-cause dementia (hazard ratio [HR], 1.02; 95\% CI, 1.00-1.04;                 P                 \,=\,.07). Although all exposures were associated with mortality, with the strongest association observed for systolic BP (HR, 1.04; 95\% CI, 1.03-1.06;                 P                 \,=\,1.9\,{\texttimes}\,10                 -14                 ), there was no evidence for selective survival bias during follow-up using illness-death models. In secondary analyses using polygenic scores, the association of genetic liability to stroke, but not genetically determined WMH, with dementia outcomes was attenuated after adjusting for interim stroke.                                                        Conclusions               These findings suggest that WMH is a primary vascular factor associated with dementia risk, emphasizing its significance in preventive strategies for dementia. Future studies are warranted to examine whether this finding can be generalized to non-European populations.},

  abstract = {Background---                              Many epidemiological studies have reported on associations between serum triglyceride concentrations and the risk of coronary heart disease, but this association has not been reliably quantified. In the present study, we report 2 separate nested case-control comparisons in 2 different prospective, population-based cohorts, plus an updated meta-analysis of 27 additional prospective studies in general Western populations.                                                          Methods and Results---                              Measurements were made in a total of 3582 incident cases of fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease and 6175 controls selected from among the 44 237 men and women screened in the Reykjavik and the European Prospective Investigation of Cancer (EPIC)-Norfolk studies. Repeat measurements were obtained an average of 4 years apart in 1933 participants in the EPIC-Norfolk Study and an average of 12 years apart in 379 participants in the Reykjavik study. The long-term stability of log-triglyceride values (within-person correlation coefficients of 0.64 [95\% CI, 0.60 to 0.68] over 4 years and 0.63 [95\% CI, 0.57 to 0.70] over 12 years) was similar to those of blood pressure and total serum cholesterol. After adjustment for baseline values of several established risk factors, the strength of the association was substantially attenuated, and the adjusted odds ratio for coronary heart disease was 1.76 (95\% CI, 1.39 to 2.21) in the Reykjavik study and 1.57 (95\% CI, 1.10 to 2.24) in the EPIC-Norfolk study in a comparison of individuals in the top third with those in the bottom third of usual log-triglyceride values. Similar overall findings (adjusted odds ratio, 1.72; 95\% CI, 1.56 to 1.90) were observed in an updated meta-analysis involving a total of 10 158 incident coronary heart disease cases from 262 525 participants in 29 studies.                                                          Conclusions---                              Available prospective studies in Western populations consistently indicate moderate and highly significant associations between triglyceride values and coronary heart disease risk. Because these associations depend considerably on levels of established risk factors, however, further studies are needed to help assess the nature of any independent associations.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Objective: To examine the spectrum of neuropathology in persons from the Rush Memory and Aging Project, a longitudinal community-based clinical-pathologic cohort study. Methods: The study includes older persons who agreed to annual clinical evaluation and brain donation. We examined the neuropathologic diagnoses, including Alzheimer disease (AD) (NIA-Reagan Criteria), cerebral infarctions, and Parkinson disease/Lewy body disease (PD/LBD), in the first 141 autopsies. We calculated the frequency of each diagnosis alone and mixed diagnoses. We used logistic regression to compare one to multiple diagnoses on the odds of dementia. Results: Twenty persons (14.2\%) had no acute or chronic brain abnormalities. The most common chronic neuropathologic diagnoses were AD (n = 80), cerebral infarctions (n = 52), and PD/LBD (n = 24). In persons with dementia (n = 50), 38.0\% (n = 19) had AD and infarcts, 30.0\% (n = 15) had pure AD, and 12\% each had vascular dementia (n = 6) and AD with PD/LBD (n = 6). In those without dementia (n = 91), 28.6\% (n = 26) had no chronic diagnostic abnormalities, 24.2\% (n = 22) had pure AD, and 17.6\% (n = 16) had infarctions. In persons with dementia, over 50\% had multiple diagnoses (AD, PD/LBD, or infarcts), whereas, in persons without dementia, over 80\% had one or no diagnosis. After accounting for age, persons with multiple diagnoses were almost three times (OR = 2.8; 95\% CI = 1.2, 6.7) more likely to exhibit dementia compared to those with one pathologic diagnosis. Conclusion: The majority of community-dwelling older persons have brain pathology. Those with dementia most often have multiple brain pathologies, which greatly increases the odds of dementia.}

  abstract = {Background: Studies that evaluate larger numbers of protein biomarkers in patients with coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) have not previously been performed, and very little is known concerning the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to CMD.Our objective was to analyze associations between a broad cardiovascular disease (CVD) protein biomarker assay and CMD, and further explore internal biomarker relations in order to identify possible targets for future treatment interventions. Methods: In 174 women with angina pectoris and no significant obstructive coronary artery disease ({$<$}50\% stenosis on invasive coronary angiography), CMD was assessed by transthoracic Doppler echocardiography measuring coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR). Blood samples were analyzed with a CVD proteomic panel encompassing 92 biomarkers. The relation between biomarkers and CFVR was evaluated by regression analysis, and possible interrelations between significant biomarkers were investigated by principal component analysis (PCA). Results: Median age (SD) was 64\,years (9.8), median CFVR (IQR) was 2.3 (1.9-2.7), and 28\% of patients had CFVR\,{$<$}\,2.0. Eighteen biomarkers were significantly correlated with CFVR. In PCA, 8 of the biomarkers significantly related to CFVR showed high loadings on principal component 1 (PC1). The component scores of PC1 were significantly related to CFVR (p\,=\,0.002). The majority of the 8 interrelated PC1 biomarkers were related to the pro-inflammatory TNF-{$\alpha$} - IL-6 - CRP pathway. Conclusion: Eighteen protein biomarkers were significantly associated with CMD. Eight biomarkers were interrelated in PCA, and share connection with pro-inflammatory pathways, highlighting a possible important role of inflammation in CMD.},

The performance of 2 concept extraction tools, MedSpaCy and MedCAT, was assessed across the corpora in both Dutch and English.The translation process effectively generated Dutch annotated corpora and the concept extraction tools performed similarly in both English and Dutch. Although there were some differences in how annotations were preserved across translations, these did not affect extraction accuracy. Supervised MedCAT models consistently outperformed unsupervised models, whereas MedSpaCy demonstrated high recall but lower precision.Our validation of Dutch concept extraction tools on corpora translated from English was successful, highlighting the efficacy of our annotation preservation method and the potential for efficiently creating multilingual corpora. Further improvements and comparisons of annotation preservation techniques and strategies for corpus synthesis could lead to more efficient development of multilingual corpora and accurate non-English concept extraction tools.This study has demonstrated that translated English corpora can be used to validate non-English concept extraction tools. The annotation preservation method used during translation proved effective, and future research can apply this corpus translation method to additional languages and clinical settings.},

In a Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for age, sex, and education, there was a nonlinear relationship between baseline level of hemoglobin such that higher and lower levels of hemoglobin were associated with AD risk (hazard ratio [HR] for the quadratic of hemoglobin 1.06, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.01--1.11). Findings were unchanged after controlling for multiple covariates. When compared to participants with clinically normal hemoglobin (n = 717), participants with anemia (n = 154) had a 60\% increased hazard for developing AD (95\% CI 1.02--2.52), as did participants with clinically high hemoglobin (n = 10, HR 3.39, 95\% CI 1.25--9.20). Linear mixed-effects models showed that lower and higher hemoglobin levels were associated with a greater rate of global cognitive decline (parameter estimate for quadratic of hemoglobin = -0.008, SE -0.002,  p   z  score unit annual decline in global cognitive function (SE 0.012,  p   p  = 0.018).  Conclusions:  In older persons without dementia, both lower and higher hemoglobin levels are associated with an increased hazard for developing AD and more rapid cognitive decline.},

In patients with acute myocardial infarction and heart failure (HF), an elevated serum level of the soluble isoform of ST2 is associated with an increased risk of mortality or future HF, independent of natriuretic peptides, and correlates with markers of ventricular structure and function. In acute HF, elevated soluble ST2 levels strongly associate with the presence and severity of the disease and forecast short- and long-term mortality independent of other traditional clinical, biochemical, and echocardiographic markers of risk. This review discusses the biology and physiology of ST2, as well as its implications on the pathogenesis and prognosis of patients with acute coronary syndromes or acute and chronic HF syndromes.},

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the associations between angiographic measures and longer-term clinical outcomes among women with signs and symptoms of ischemia referred for coronary angiography. METHODS: A prospective cohort analysis of women referred for coronary angiography and enrolled in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-sponsored WISE was performed. An angiographic severity score was prospectively developed, assigning points for any stenosis weighted by stenosis severity, location, and collaterals and was then tested for prediction for adverse outcome in 917 women, over a median of 9.3 years. SETTING: The study was conducted in referral centers. PATIENTS: Women with signs and/or symptoms of myocardial ischemia referred for coronary angiography were consecutively consented and enrolled in a prospective study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Main outcomes included first occurrence of cardiovascular death or nonfatal myocardial infarction. Hospitalization for angina was a secondary outcome. RESULTS: Cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction at 10 years occurred in 6.7\%, 12.8\%, and 25.9\% of women with no, nonobstructive, and obstructive CAD (P {$<$} .0001), respectively. Cumulative 10-year cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction rates showed progressive, near-linear increases for each WISE CAD severity score range of 5, 5.1 to 10, 10.1 to 20, 20.1 to 50, and {$>$}50. The optimal threshold in the WISE severity score classifications for predicting cardiovascular mortality was {$>$}10 (eg, 5.0-10 vs 10.1-89), with both a sensitivity and specificity of 0.64 and an area under the curve of 0.64 (P = .02, 95\% CI 0.59-0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Among women with signs and symptoms of ischemia, nonobstructive CAD is common and associated with adverse outcomes over the longer term. The new WISE angiographic score appears to be useful for risk prediction in this population.},

BACKGROUND: A number of diagnostic strategies are available with few data to compare the cost implications of the initial test choice. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 11,372 consecutive stable angina patients who were referred for stress myocardial perfusion tomography or cardiac catheterization. Stress imaging patients were matched by their pretest clinical risk of coronary disease to a series of patients referred to cardiac catheterization. Composite 3-year costs of care were compared for two patients management strategies: 1) direct cardiac catheterization (aggressive) and 2) initial stress myocardial perfusion tomography and selective catheterization of high risk patients (conservative). Analysis of variance techniques were used to compare costs, adjusting for treatment propensity and pretest risk. RESULTS: Observational comparisons of aggressive as compared with conservative testing strategies reveal that costs of care were higher for direct cardiac catheterization in all clinical risk subsets (range: \$2,878 to \$4,579), as compared with stress myocardial perfusion imaging plus selective catheterization (range: \$2,387 to \$3,010, p {$<$} 0.0001). Coronary revascularization rates were higher for low, intermediate and high risk direct catheterization patients as compared with the initial stress perfusion imaging cohort (13\% to 50\%, p {$<$} 0.0001); cardiac death or myocardial infarction rates were similar (p {$>$} 0.20). CONCLUSIONS: Observational assessments reveal that stable chest pain patients who undergo a more aggressive diagnostic strategy have higher diagnostic costs and greater rates of intervention and follow-up costs. Cost differences may reflect a diminished necessity for resource consumption for patients with normal test results.},

Rates of clot retrieval and successful recanalization (Arterial Occlusive Lesion score of 2-3) for separate retrieval trials were evaluated. The area occupied by red blood cell (RBC), fibrin/platelets, and white blood cell (WBC) was measured from digitized images of hematoxylin-eosin stained clots. Compositional differences were compared according to recanalization success, stroke subtype, and the presence of hyperdense clot sign on initial computed tomography and/or blooming artifact on magnetic resonance image. Of the 145 total retrieval trials (3.4{\textpm}2.4 times per patient), clot was retrieved in 93 trials (64\%), while recanalization was successful in 73 (50\%). Fibrin/platelets (63\%) occupied the greatest area in retrieved clots, followed by RBCs (33\%) and WBCs (4\%). Clots retrieved from successful recanalization exhibited higher RBC composition (37\%) than those retrieved from non-recanalization trials (20\%, p = 0.001). RBC composition was higher in cardioembolic stroke (38\%) rather than large artery atherosclerosis (23\%) and undetermined etiology (26\%, p = 0.01). Clots exhibiting clot signs (40\%) had higher RBC composition than those without clot signs (19\%, p = 0.001). RBC-rich clots were associated with successful recanalization of intra-arterial thrombectomy, cardioembolic stroke, and the presence of clot-signs on initial brain images.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Nearly one-third of patients presenting with angina have unobstructed epicardial coronary arteries and evidence of coronary microvascular disease. Up until recently, the pathophysiology of coronary microvascular disease has been poorly understood, resulting in limited effective therapeutic options in these patients. As a result, patients with coronary microvascular disease continue to suffer from a poor quality of life and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent mechanistic studies have improved our understanding of the pathophysiology underlying coronary microvascular dysfunction; these studies have implicated the nitric oxide and endothelin pathways as the main drivers. The aim of this article is to review our current understanding of the pathophysiology of ischaemia in patients with coronary microvascular disease. SUMMARY: Patients with angina who have coronary microvascular disease, but no obstructive coronary artery disease, are unable to augment their coronary blood flow in response to physiological stress, thereby predisposing them to myocardial ischaemia as a result of supply:demand mismatch in the myocardium. In addition to abnormalities of vascular resistance, perturbations in cardiac-coronary coupling also contribute to ischaemia in these patients. Although impaired flow reserve is the diagnostic hallmark, mechanistic studies have demonstrated that the underlying pathophysiology is heterogeneous. At present, two main endotypes have been identified, which can be readily differentiated on the basis of minimal microvascular resistance. A better understanding of the pathophysiology and mechanisms driving ischaemia in coronary microvascular dysfunction may stimulate the development of individualised therapies that may lead to an improvement in patients' quality of life and prognosis.},

  abstract = {Introduction---               Endovascular thrombectomy is a highly efficacious treatment for large vessel occlusion (LVO). LVO prediction instruments, based on stroke signs and symptoms, have been proposed to identify stroke patients with LVO for rapid transport to endovascular thrombectomy--capable hospitals. This evidence review committee was commissioned by the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association to systematically review evidence for the accuracy of LVO prediction instruments.                                         Methods---               Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched on October 27, 2016. Study quality was assessed with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy-2 tool.                                         Results---               Thirty-six relevant studies were identified. Most studies (21 of 36) recruited patients with ischemic stroke, with few studies in the prehospital setting (4 of 36) and in populations that included hemorrhagic stroke or stroke mimics (12 of 36). The most frequently studied prediction instrument was the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale. Most studies had either some risk of bias or unclear risk of bias. Reported discrimination of LVO mostly ranged from 0.70 to 0.85, as measured by the C statistic. In meta-analysis, sensitivity was as high as 87\% and specificity was as high as 90\%, but no threshold on any instruments predicted LVO with both high sensitivity and specificity. With a positive LVO prediction test, the probability of LVO could be 50\% to 60\% (depending on the LVO prevalence in the population), but the probability of LVO with a negative test could still be {$\geq$}10\%.                                         Conclusions---               No scale predicted LVO with both high sensitivity and high specificity. Systems that use LVO prediction instruments for triage will miss some patients with LVO and milder stroke. More prospective studies are needed to assess the accuracy of LVO prediction instruments in the prehospital setting in all patients with suspected stroke, including patients with hemorrhagic stroke and stroke mimics.},

  abstract = {Atherosclerosis, a dominant and growing cause of death and disability worldwide, involves inflammation from its inception to the emergence of complications. Targeting inflammatory pathways could therefore provide a promising new avenue to prevent and treat atherosclerosis. Indeed, clinical studies have now demonstrated unequivocally that modulation of inflammation can forestall the clinical complications of atherosclerosis. This progress pinpoints the need for preclinical investigations to refine strategies for combatting inflammation in the human disease. In this Review, we consider a gamut of attractive possibilities for modifying inflammation in atherosclerosis, including targeting pivotal inflammatory pathways such as the inflammasomes, inhibiting cytokines, manipulating adaptive immunity and promoting pro-resolution mechanisms. Along with lifestyle measures, pharmacological interventions to mute inflammation could complement traditional targets, such as lipids and hypertension, to make new inroads into the management of atherosclerotic risk.},

We hypothesized that WM injury as seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) would correlate with regions of increased MMP activity. MRI was performed 3 days after BCAO surgery in rats. Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) were calculated and vascular permeability was quantified by the multiple-time graphical analysis (MTGA) method, using gadolinium-diethylenetriamine pentaacid (Gd-DTPA). After MRI, one group of animals had BBB permeability measured in the WM with (14)C-sucrose, and another had Evans blue (EB) injected for fluorescent microscopy for MMP-2, MMP-9, tight junction proteins (TJPs), and in situ zymography. We found that ADC values were increased in WM in BCAO rats compared with controls (P{$<$}0.05). WM with increased ADC had leakage of EB. MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity on in situ zymograms corresponded with leakage of EB. Although increased permeability to EB could be visualized, permeability quantification with (14)C-sucrose and Gd-DTPA failed to show increases and TJPs were intact. We propose that increased ADC, which is a marker of vasogenic edema, is related to activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9. MRI provides unique information that can be used to guide tissue studies of WM injury.},

  abstract = {AIMS: Epidemiological studies suggest that sex has a role in the pathogenesis of cardioembolic stroke. Since stroke is a vascular disease, identifying sexually dimorphic gene expression changes in blood leukocytes can inform on sex-specific risk factors, response and outcome biology. We aimed to examine the sexually dimorphic immune response following cardioembolic stroke by studying the differential gene expression in peripheral white blood cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: Blood samples from patients with cardioembolic stroke were obtained at {$\leq$}3 hours (prior to treatment), 5 hours and 24 hours (after treatment) after stroke onset (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}23; 69 samples) and compared with vascular risk factor controls without symptomatic vascular diseases (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}23, 23 samples) (ANCOVA, false discovery rate p{$\leq$}0.05, {\textbar}fold change{\textbar} {$\geq$}1.2). mRNA levels were measured on whole-genome Affymetrix microarrays. There were more up-regulated than down-regulated genes in both sexes, and females had more differentially expressed genes than males following cardioembolic stroke. Female gene expression was associated with cell death and survival, cell-cell signaling and inflammation. Male gene expression was associated with cellular assembly, organization and compromise. Immune response pathways were over represented at {$\leq$}3, 5 and 24 h after stroke in female subjects but only at 24 h in males. Neutrophil-specific genes were differentially expressed at 3, 5 and 24 h in females but only at 5 h and 24 h in males. CONCLUSIONS: There are sexually dimorphic immune cell expression profiles following cardioembolic stroke. Future studies are needed to confirm the findings using qRT-PCR in an independent cohort, to determine how they relate to risk and outcome, and to compare to other causes of ischemic stroke.},

Women may be more likely to present with atypical symptoms, but this hypothesis has not been extensively evaluated. METHODS: We examined gender differences in the prevalence of presenting and prodromal stroke symptoms among 1107 consecutive patients hospitalized with neurologist-confirmed acute ischemic stroke. Patient demographics, clinical variables, and stroke symptoms were abstracted from medical records by trained abstractors using standardized forms. Estimates were age-standardized to the age distribution of men and women combined. Presenting symptoms occurred within 24 hours of incident stroke admission; prodromal symptoms occurred {$>$}or=24 hours of admission. RESULTS: Women were significantly older (P{$<$}0.001), more likely to have cardioembolic stroke (P{$<$}0.01), and less likely to receive aspirin (P=0.014) or statins (P{$<$}0.001). Thirty-five percent of the sample (n=389) reported prodromal symptoms. Women were more likely to have {$>$}or=1 somatic prodromal and presenting symptoms (P=0.03; P=0.008), but did not differ from men on specific somatic symptoms. Women did not differ from men in classic presenting stroke symptoms (P=0.89). CONCLUSIONS: Women did not differ significantly in the prevalence of traditional stroke symptoms but were more likely to have somatic presenting and prodromal symptoms. We found no differences in specific prodromal symptoms, making it difficult to craft a public health message about gender differences in early warning signs of stroke. These results suggest that the focus of stroke prevention education for women should continue to emphasize traditional stroke risk factors.},

METHODS: Three hundred ninety controls and 672 participants with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and 254 with Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative completed the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) and [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET. Cross-sectional analyses were conducted using linear regression to examine the sex by TLGluMR interaction on RAVLT performance in the overall sample and within diagnostic groups adjusting for age, education, and APOE {$\varepsilon$}4 genotype. RESULTS: Across groups, female sex and higher TLGluMR and their interaction were associated with better verbal memory (p values {$\leq$} 0.005). The female advantage in verbal memory varied by TLGluMR such that the advantage was greatest among individuals with moderate to high TLGluMR and minimal or absent among individuals with lower TLGluMR. Diagnosis-stratified analyses revealed that this interaction was driven by the aMCI group (p values = 0.009). The interaction was not significant in control and AD dementia groups. CONCLUSIONS: Women show better verbal memory than men in aMCI despite similar levels of brain hypometabolism. The lifelong advantage that females show over males in verbal memory might represent a form of cognitive reserve that delays verbal memory decline until more advanced pathology, as indexed by TLGluMR. This issue is clinically important because verbal memory scores are used in diagnosing aMCI and AD dementia.},

Its goal is to achieve a comprehensive and objective global network, including direct (physical) as well as indirect (functional) interactions. The latest version of STRING (11.0) more than doubles the number of organisms it covers, to 5090. The most important new feature is an option to upload entire, genome-wide datasets as input, allowing users to visualize subsets as interaction networks and to perform gene-set enrichment analysis on the entire input. For the enrichment analysis, STRING implements well-known classification systems such as Gene Ontology and KEGG, but also offers additional, new classification systems based on high-throughput text-mining as well as on a hierarchical clustering of the association network itself.

To assess gene expression in these peripheral white blood cells, whole blood was examined using oligonucleotide microarrays in 15 patients at 2.4 {\textpm} 0.5, 5 and 24 h after onset of ischemic stroke and compared with control blood samples. The 2.4 h blood samples were drawn before patients were treated either with tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) alone or with tPA plus Eptifibatide (the Combination approach to Lysis utilizing Eptifibatide And Recombinant tPA trial). Most genes induced in whole blood at 2 to 3 h were also induced at 5 and 24 h. Separate studies showed that the genes induced at 2 to 24 h after stroke were expressed mainly by polymorphonuclear leukocytes and to a lesser degree by monocytes. These genes included: matrix metalloproteinase 9; S100 calcium-binding proteins P, A12 and A9; coagulation factor V; arginase I; carbonic anhydrase IV; lymphocyte antigen 96 (cluster of differentiation (CD)96); monocarboxylic acid transporter (6); ets-2 (erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog 2); homeobox gene Hox 1.11; cytoskeleton-associated protein 4; N-formylpeptide receptor; ribonuclease-2; N-acetylneuraminate pyruvate lyase; BCL6; glycogen phosphorylase. The fold change of these genes varied from 1.6 to 6.8 and these 18 genes correctly classified 10/15 patients at 2.4 h, 13/15 patients at 5h and 15/15 patients at 24 h after stroke. These data provide insights into the inflammatory responses after stroke in humans, and should be helpful in diagnosis, understanding etiology and pathogenesis, and guiding acute treatment and development of new treatments for stroke.},

  abstract = {Soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) is associated with hypertension, vascular inflammation, and systemic endothelial dysfunction. We evaluated whether elevated plasma sVCAM-1 is associated with impaired cerebrovascular function and mobility impairments in elderly people. We studied the cross-sectional relationships between plasma sVCAM-1 level, gait speed, and cerebrovascular hemodynamics, and its longitudinal relationship with falls in 680 community-dwelling participants aged {$\geq$}65 years in the Maintenance of Balance, Independent Living, Intellect, and Zest in the Elderly (MOBILIZE) Boston Study. Falls were recorded prospectively for 1 year on daily calendars. sVCAM-1 was measured by ELISA assay and beat-to-beat blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery during rest and in response to changes in end-tidal CO2 was measured by transcranial Doppler ultrasound. sVCAM-1 concentration was 1094{\textpm}340 ng/mL in normotensives, 1195{\textpm}438 ng/mL in controlled hypertensives, and 1250{\textpm}445 ng/mL in uncontrolled hypertensives (P=0.008). The mean resting blood flow velocity and cerebral vasomotor range were, respectively, 41.0{\textpm}10.3 cm/s and 1.3{\textpm}0.4 cm/s per millimeter of mercury. Elevated sVCAM-1 levels indicative of endothelial dysfunction were associated with reduced resting blood flow velocity (P=0.017) and cerebral vasomotor range (P=0.0048). Elevated sVCAM-1 levels were associated with slower gait speed ({$<$}0.8 m/s; odds ratio, 3.01; 95\% confidence interval, 1.56-5.83; P=0.0011) and an increased odds of injurious falls (odds ratio, 2.4; 95\% confidence interval, 1.4-4.2; P=0.0028). An elevated sVCAM-1 level may be a marker of cerebral blood flow dysregulation because of endothelial damage from hypertension. It may also signal the presence of cerebral microvascular disease and its clinical consequences, including slow gait speed and falls.},

  abstract = {The nature and severity of behavioral problems, and their relationship to cognitive and functional abilities, was investigated in 56 community-residing patients with Alzheimer's disease. Measures evaluated three domains of function: behavior, cognition and activities of daily living. Problems of cognitive functioning, such as memory loss, confusion, and disorientation were most prevalent, reported to occur in 84\%, 82\%, and 64\% of the sample, respectively. Problems with activity and emotional distress were next, affecting 20 to 43\% of the sample. The mean number of problems reported was 10 per patient. Twenty-two percent of caregivers reported a minimum of 15 problems occurring at least twice a week and no caregiver reported an absence of problems. Male patients were reported to have more behavioral difficulties. Level of behavioral disturbance was largely unrelated to cognitive or functional ability. Age was unrelated to cognitive or behavioral disturbance but significantly related to activities of daily living. Results indicated that behavioral problems are prevalent and pervasive in even moderately impaired community-residing Alzheimer disease patients, and that age may be more important than level of cognitive dysfunction in predicting difficulties with activities of daily living.},

Methods We measured the biomarkers with Simoa in two separate cohorts (n~=~160 and n~=~152). In one cohort, A?1-42/1-40 was also measured with mass spectrometry (MS). We assessed the differential diagnostic value of the markers, by logistic regression with Wald's backward selection. Results MS and Simoa A?1-42/1-40 similarly differentiated AD from controls. The Simoa panel that optimally differentiated AD from FTD consisted of NfL and p-tau181 (area under the curve [AUC]~=~0.94; cohort 1) or NfL, GFAP, and p-tau181 (AUC~=~0.90; cohort 2). For AD from DLB, the panel consisted of NfL, p-tau181, and GFAP (AUC~=~0.88; cohort 1), and only p-tau181 (AUC~=~0.81; cohort 2). Discussion A combination of plasma p-tau181, NfL, and GFAP, but not A?1-42/1-40, might be useful to discriminate AD, FTD, and DLB.},

We thus hypothesized that endovascular treatment shows different efficacy in cardioembolic versus noncardioembolic large-vessel occlusions (LVOs). Methods- Procedural characteristics, grade of reperfusion, and functional outcome at discharge and 90 days were compared between patients with cardioembolic versus noncardioembolic LVO from the GSR-ET (German Stroke Registry-Endovascular Treatment; n=2589). To determine associations with functional outcome, adjusted odds ratios and 95\% CIs were calculated using ordinal multivariable logistic regression models adjusting for potential baseline confounder variables. Results- Endovascular treatment of cardioembolic LVO had a higher rate of successful reperfusion (85.6\% versus 81.0\%; P=0.002) and a higher rate of complete reperfusion after a single thrombectomy pass (45.7\% versus 38.1\%; P{$<$}0.001) compared with noncardioembolic LVO. Cardioembolic LVO was associated with better functional outcome at discharge (adjusted odds ratio, 1.61 [95\% CI, 1.37-1.88]) and 90 days (adjusted odds ratio, 1.29 [95\% CI, 1.09-1.53]). In mediation analysis, reperfusion explained 47\% of the effect of etiology on functional outcome at discharge. Conclusions- These results provide evidence for higher efficacy of endovascular treatment in cardioembolic LVO compared with noncardioembolic LVO.},

We examined the association between RDW and the risk of all-cause mortality and adverse cardiovascular outcomes in a population of people with coronary disease who were free of heart failure at baseline.                                                          Methods and Results---                              We performed a post hoc analysis of data from the Cholesterol and Recurrent Events study. Baseline RDW was measured in 4111 participants who were randomized to receive pravastatin 40 mg daily or placebo and followed for a median of 59.7 months. We used Cox proportional hazards models to examine the association between RDW and adverse clinical outcomes. During nearly 60 months of follow-up, 376 participants died. A significant association was noted between baseline RDW level and the adjusted risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio per percent increase in RDW, 1.14; 95\% confidence interval, 1.05 to 1.24). After categorization based on quartile of baseline RDW and further adjustment for hematocrit and other cardiovascular risk factors, a graded independent relation between RDW and death was observed (               P               for trend=0.001). For instance, participants with RDW in the highest quartile had an adjusted hazard ratio for death of 1.78 (95\% confidence interval, 1.28 to 2.47) compared with those in the lowest quartile. Higher levels of RDW were also associated with increased risk of coronary death/nonfatal myocardial infarction, new symptomatic heart failure, and stroke.

Objective:               This study: (1) developed a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm that identifies common neuropsychiatric symptoms of ADRD in HHC free-text clinical notes; (2) described symptom clusters and hospitalization or emergency department (ED) visit rates for patients with and without these symptoms.                                         Method:               We examined a corpus of -2.6\,million free-text notes for 112,237 HHC episodes among 89,459 patients admitted to a non-profit HHC agency for post-acute care with any diagnosis. We used NLP software (NimbleMiner) to construct indicators of six neuropsychiatric symptoms. Structured HHC assessment data were used to identify known ADRD diagnoses and construct measures of hospitalization/ED use during HHC.                                         Results:               Neuropsychiatric symptoms were documented for 40\% of episodes. Common clusters included impaired memory, anxiety and/or depressed mood. One in three episodes without an ADRD diagnosis had documented symptoms. Hospitalization/ED rates increased with one or more symptoms present.                                         Conclusion:               HHC providers should examine episodes with neuropsychiatric symptoms but no ADRD diagnoses to determine whether ADRD diagnosis was missed or to recommend ADRD evaluation. NLP-generated symptom indicators can help to identify high-risk patients for targeted interventions.},

Patients may have pruritus (33\%), erythromelalgia (5.3\%), transient visual changes (14\%), and splenomegaly (36\%) with abdominal discomfort. More than 95\% of patients have a JAK2 gene variant, which helps distinguish PV from secondary causes of erythrocytosis, such as tobacco smoking or sleep apnea. Among 7 cohorts (1545 individuals), the median survival from diagnosis was 14.1 to 27.6 years. Prior to or at the time of PV diagnosis, arterial thrombosis occurred in 16\% of patients and 7\% had venous thrombotic events, which could involve unusual sites, such as splanchnic veins. PV is also associated with an increased bleeding risk, especially in patients with acquired von Willebrand disease, which can occur with extreme thrombocytosis (platelet count, {$\geq$}1000\,{\texttimes}\,109/L). All patients with PV should receive therapeutic phlebotomy (goal hematocrit, \&lt;45\%) and low-dose aspirin (if no contraindications). Patients who are at higher risk of thrombosis include those aged 60 years or older or with a prior thrombosis. These patients and those with persistent PV symptoms may benefit from cytoreductive therapy with hydroxyurea or interferon to lower thrombosis risk and decrease symptoms. Ruxolitinib is a Janus kinase inhibitor that can alleviate pruritus and decrease splenomegaly in patients who are intolerant of or resistant to hydroxyurea. About 12.7\% of patients with PV develop myelofibrosis and 6.8\% develop acute myeloid leukemia.PV is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by erythrocytosis and is almost universally associated with a JAK2 gene variant. PV is associated with an increased risk of arterial and venous thrombosis, hemorrhage, myelofibrosis, and acute myeloid leukemia. To decrease the risk of thrombosis, all patients with PV should be treated with aspirin and therapeutic phlebotomy to maintain a hematocrit of less than 45\%. Cytoreductive therapies, such as hydroxyurea or interferon, are recommended for patients at high risk of thrombosis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Machine learning has attracted considerable research interest toward developing smart digital health interventions. These interventions have the potential to revolutionize health care and lead to substantial outcomes for patients and medical professionals. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to review the literature on applications of machine learning in real-life digital health interventions, aiming to improve the understanding of researchers, clinicians, engineers, and policy makers in developing robust and impactful data-driven interventions in the health care domain. METHODS: We searched the PubMed and Scopus bibliographic databases with terms related to machine learning, to identify real-life studies of digital health interventions incorporating machine learning algorithms. We grouped those interventions according to their target (ie, target condition), study design, number of enrolled participants, follow-up duration, primary outcome and whether this had been statistically significant, machine learning algorithms used in the intervention, and outcome of the algorithms (eg, prediction). RESULTS: Our literature search identified 8 interventions incorporating machine learning in a real-life research setting, of which 3 (37\%) were evaluated in a randomized controlled trial and 5 (63\%) in a pilot or experimental single-group study. The interventions targeted depression prediction and management, speech recognition for people with speech disabilities, self-efficacy for weight loss, detection of changes in biopsychosocial condition of patients with multiple morbidity, stress management, treatment of phantom limb pain, smoking cessation, and personalized nutrition based on glycemic response. The average number of enrolled participants in the studies was 71 (range 8-214), and the average follow-up study duration was 69 days (range 3-180). Of the 8 interventions, 6 (75\%) showed statistical significance (at the P=.05 level) in health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This review found that digital health interventions incorporating machine learning algorithms in real-life studies can be useful and effective. Given the low number of studies identified in this review and that they did not follow a rigorous machine learning evaluation methodology, we urge the research community to conduct further studies in intervention settings following evaluation principles and demonstrating the potential of machine learning in clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Activated platelets play a role in the pathogenesis of coronary heart disease (CHD). Following activation, platelets change shape, aggregate, and release several bioactive substances. The aim of this review is to identify if there is a simple and cost-effective method that indicates platelet activation and predicts the risk of CHD and vascular events. The rationale for identifying high-risk patients is to reduce their risk of vascular events by administering appropriate and effective antiplatelet treatment, like aspirin, clopidogrel, or combination regimens. Many laboratory tests estimating platelet activity have been described. Some are relatively simple, such as spontaneous or agonist-induced platelet aggregation. Other tests include measuring the mean platelet volume (MPV) or plasma soluble P-selectin levels. Some more complex tests include flow cytometry to determine platelet GP Ilb/Illa receptors, platelet surface P-selectin, plateletmonocyte aggregates, and microparticles. Only few prospective studies assessed the predictive value of platelet activation in healthy individuals. Although the MPV seems an 'easy method, there are insufficient data supporting its ability to predict the risk of a vascular event in healthy adults. Platelet aggregation, in whole blood or in platelet-rich plasma was not consistently predictive of vascular risk. Soluble P-selectin measurement is a promising method but it needs further evaluation. Flow cytometry methods are costly, time-consuming, and need specialized equipment. Thus, they are unlikely to be useful in estimating the risk in large numbers of patients. There is as yet no ideal test for the detection of platelet activation. Each currently available test has merits and disadvantages. Simple methods such as the MPV and the determination of platelet release products need further evaluation.},

We report a prospectively collected clinical experience with a new technique utilizing a direct aspiration first pass technique with large bore aspiration catheter as the primary method for vessel recanalization. METHODS: 98 prospectively identified acute ischemic stroke patients with 100 occluded large cerebral vessels at six institutions were included in the study. The ADAPT technique was utilized in all patients. Procedural and clinical data were captured for analysis. RESULTS: The aspiration component of the ADAPT technique alone was successful in achieving Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) 2b or 3 revascularization in 78\% of cases. The additional use of stent retrievers improved the TICI 2b/3 revascularization rate to 95\%. The average time from groin puncture to at least TICI 2b recanalization was 37 min. A 5MAX demonstrated similar success to a 5MAX ACE in achieving TICI 2b/3 revascularization alone (75\% vs 82\%, p=0.43). Patients presented with an admitting median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 17.0 (12.0-21.0) and improved to a median NIHSS score at discharge of 7.3 (1.0-11.0). Ninety day functional outcomes were 40\% (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0-2) and 20\% (mRS 6). There were two procedural complications and no symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhages. DISCUSSION: The ADAPT technique is a fast, safe, simple, and effective method that has facilitated our approach to acute ischemic stroke thrombectomy by utilizing the latest generation of large bore aspiration catheters to achieve previously unparalleled angiographic outcomes.},

Numerous biomarkers have been investigated for predicting either the progression or the severity of the disease. The aim of this retrospective study was to compare hematologic indices among patients referred for surgical interventions due to severe carotid disease. Methods: In total, 135 patients (87 (64.4\%) men and 48 (35.6\%) women) with a mean age of 70 {\textpm} 8 years who underwent surgical carotid intervention were enrolled into the study. Results: A Mann--Whitney test for independent samples revealed significant differences in monocyte to lymphocyte ratio (MLR) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) between patients with one and two (collateral) carotid diseases. The cut-off value for MLR was 0.3 (AUC = 0.654, p = 0.048, 70.0\% sensitivity and 74.6\% specificity) and for MHCH was 21.6. (AUC = 0.730, p {$<$} 0.001, 70.0\% sensitivity and 77.2\% specificity).

  abstract = {Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) is a major cause of stroke and dementia. This review summarizes recent developments in advanced neuroimaging of cSVD with a focus on clinical and research applications. In the first section, we highlight how advanced structural imaging techniques, including diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), enable improved detection of tissue damage, including characterization of tissue appearing normal on conventional MRI. These techniques enable progression to be monitored and may be useful as surrogate endpoint in clinical trials. Quantitative MRI, including iron and myelin imaging, provides insights into tissue composition on the molecular level. In the second section, we cover how advanced MRI techniques can demonstrate functional or dynamic abnormalities of the blood vessels, which could be targeted in mechanistic research and early-stage intervention trials. Such techniques include the use of dynamic contrast enhanced MRI to measure blood-brain barrier permeability, and MRI methods to assess cerebrovascular reactivity. In the third section, we discuss how the increased spatial resolution provided by ultrahigh field MRI at 7\,T allows imaging of perforating arteries, and flow velocity and pulsatility within them. The advanced MRI techniques we describe are providing novel pathophysiological insights in cSVD and allow improved quantification of disease burden and progression. They have application in clinical trials, both in assessing novel therapeutic mechanisms, and as a sensitive endpoint to assess efficacy of interventions on parenchymal tissue damage. We also discuss challenges of these advanced techniques and suggest future directions for research.},

Cerebral hypoperfusion has been proposed as a causal factor. We studied CMI in patients with internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion, as a model for cerebral hemodynamic compromise. We included 95 patients with a complete ICA occlusion (age 66.2\,{\textpm}\,8.3, 22\% female) and 125 reference participants (age 65.5\,{\textpm}\,7.4, 47\% female). Participants underwent clinical, neuropsychological, and 3\,T brain MRI assessment. CMI were more common in patients with an ICA occlusion (54\%, median 2, range 1--33) than in the reference group (6\%, median 0; range 1--7; OR 14.3; 95\% CI 6.2--33.1; p{$<$}.001). CMI were more common ipsilateral to the occlusion than in the contralateral hemisphere (median 2 and 0 respectively; p{$<$}.001). In patients with CMI compared to patients without CMI, the number of additional occluded or stenosed cervical arteries was higher (p=.038), and cerebral blood flow was lower (B -6.2\,ml/min/100\,ml; 95\% CI -12.0:--0.41; p=.036). In conclusion, CMI are common in patients with an ICA occlusion, particularly in the hemisphere of the occluded ICA. CMI burden was related to the severity of cervical arterial compromise, supporting a role of hemodynamics in CMI etiology.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cerebral small vessel diseases (SVDs) are a major cause of stroke and dementia. Yet, specific treatment strategies are lacking in part because of a limited understanding of the underlying disease processes. There is therefore an urgent need to study SVDs at their core, the small vessels themselves. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents the rationale and design of the ZOOM@SVDs study, which aims to establish measures of cerebral small vessel dysfunction on 7T MRI as novel disease markers of SVDs. METHODS: ZOOM@SVDs is a prospective observational cohort study with two years follow-up. ZOOM@SVDs recruits participants with Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL, N~=~20), sporadic SVDs (N~=~60), and healthy controls (N~=~40). Participants undergo 7T brain MRI to assess different aspects of small vessel function including small vessel reactivity, cerebral perforating artery flow, and pulsatility. Extensive work-up at baseline and follow-up further includes clinical and neuropsychological assessment as well as 3T brain MRI to assess conventional SVD imaging markers. Measures of small vessel dysfunction are compared between patients and controls, and related to the severity of clinical and conventional MRI manifestations of SVDs. DISCUSSION: ZOOM@SVDs will deliver novel markers of cerebral small vessel function in patients with monogenic and sporadic forms of SVDs, and establish their relation with disease burden and progression. These small vessel markers can support etiological studies in SVDs and may serve as surrogate outcome measures in future clinical trials to show target engagement of drugs directed at the small vessels.},

  abstract = {The term vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) was introduced around the start of the new millennium and refers to the contribution of vascular pathology to any severity of cognitive impairment, ranging from subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment to dementia. Although vascular pathology is common in elderly individuals with cognitive decline, pure vascular dementia (that is, dementia caused solely by vascular pathology) is uncommon. Indeed, most patients with vascular dementia also have other types of pathology, the most common of which is Alzheimer disease (specifically, the diffuse accumulation of amyloid-{$\beta$} plaques and neurofibrillary tangles composed of tau). At present, the main treatment for VCI is prevention by treating vascular diseases and other risk factors for VCI, such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Despite the current paucity of disease-modifying pharmacological treatments, we foresee that eventually, we might be able to target specific brain diseases to prevent cognitive decline and dementia.},

Here we describe these histological WSI data available for the Athero-Express (AE) and Aneurysm-Express (AAA) Biobank Studies (http://www.atheroexpress.nl). The AE started in 2002 and now includes over 3,500 patients who underwent surgery to remove atherosclerotic plaques (endarterectomy) from one (or more) of their major arteries (majority carotids and femorals). The AAA started in 2003 and now includes over 1,000 patients who underwent open surgery on arterial aneurysms, the majority on aortic aneurysms. The staining protocols are described by Verhoeven et al. (AE) and Hurks et al. (AAA). Whole-slide images are available for the several commonly used stains, but note that these are not available in all samples in both studies. A table showing the approximate numbers of available WSI is given here. slideToolKit These data are also used for slideToolKit and other ExpressScan projects (see below).

  abstract = {Inflammation is an important candidate mechanism underlying cancer and cancer treatment-related cognitive impairment. We investigated levels of blood cell--based inflammatory markers in breast cancer survivors on average 20 years after chemotherapy and explored the relation between these markers and global cognitive performance. One hundred sixty-six breast cancer survivors who received post-surgical radiotherapy and six cycles of adjuvant cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) chemotherapy on average 20 years before enrollment were compared with 1344 cancer-free women from a population-based sample (50--80 years old). Breast cancer survivors were excluded if they used adjuvant hormonal therapy or if they developed relapse, metastasis, or second primary malignancies. Systemic inflammation status was assessed by the granulocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (GLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and systemic immune-inflammation index (SII). Cognitive performance was assessed using an extensive neuropsychological test battery from which the general cognitive factor was derived to evaluate global cognitive performance. We examined the association between cancer, the general cognitive factor, and inflammatory markers using linear regression models. Breast cancer survivors had a lower general cognitive factor than non-exposed participants from the comparator group (mean difference = -0.21; 95\% confidence interval (CI) -0.35 to -0.06). Inflammatory markers were higher in cancer survivors compared with non-exposed participants (mean difference for log(GLR) = 0.31; 95\% CI 0.24 to 0.37, log(PLR) = 0.14; 95\% CI 0.09 to 0.19, log(SII) = 0.31; 95\% CI 0.24 to 0.39). The association between higher levels of inflammatory markers and lower general cognitive factor was statistically significant in cancer survivors but not among non-exposed participants. We found a group-by-inflammatory marker interaction; cancer survivors showed additional lower general cognitive factor per standard deviation increase in inflammatory markers (P for interaction for GLR = 0.038, PLR = 0.003, and SII = 0.033). This is the first study to show that (1) cancer survivors have increased levels of inflammation on average 20 years after treatment and (2) these inflammatory levels are associated with lower cognitive performance. Although this association needs verification by a prospective study to determine causality, our findings can stimulate research on the role of inflammation in long-term cognitive problems and possibilities to diminish such problems.},

  abstract = {Myocardial infarction (MI) induces an inflammatory response in which neutrophils fulfill a prominent role. Mean neutrophil volume (MNV) represents the average size of the circulating neutrophil population. Our goal was to determine the effect of MI on MNV and investigate the mechanisms behind MNV elevation. MNV of 84 MI patients was compared with the MNV of 209 stable angina patients and correlated to simultaneously measured CK levels. Fourteen pigs were subjected to temporary coronary balloon occlusion and blood was sampled at multiple time points to measure MNV. Echocardiography was performed followed by ex vivo infarct size assessment after 72~h. MNV was higher in MI patients compared to stable angina patients (602 SD26~AU vs. 580 SD20~AU, p~{$<~$}0.0001) and correlated with simultaneously measured CK levels (R~=~0.357, p~{$<~$}0.0001). In pigs, MNV was elevated post-MI (451 SD11~AU vs. 469 SD12~AU), p~{$<~$}0.0001). MNV correlated with infarct size (R~=~0.705, p~=~0.007) and inversely correlated with left ventricular ejection fraction (R~=~-0.718, p~=~0.009). Cell sorting revealed an increased presence of banded neutrophils after MI, which have a higher MNV compared to mature neutrophils post-MI (495 SD14~AU vs. 478 SD11~AU, p~=~0.012). MNV from coronary sinus blood was higher than MNV of neutrophils from simultaneously sampled arterial blood (463 SD7.6~AU vs. 461 SD8.6~AU, p~=~0.013) post-MI. The current study shows MNV is elevated and reflects cardiac damage post-MI. MNV increases due to altered neutrophil composition and systemic neutrophil activation. MNV may be an interesting parameter for prognostic assessment in MI and provide new insights into pathological innate immune responses evoked by ischemia-reperfusion.},

The aim of this study was to determine whether, in the presence of clinically manifest carotid or peripheral artery disease, secondary adverse cardiovascular events decreased over this period.                                         Methods               Patients included in the Athero-Express biobank between 2003 and 2012 were analysed. During 3-year follow-up, composite cardiovascular endpoints were documented yearly, including: myocardial infarction, coronary interventions, stroke, peripheral interventions and cardiovascular death. The major cardiovascular endpoint consisted of myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiovascular death.                                         Results               Some 1684 patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and another 530 who had iliofemoral endarterectomy (IFE) were analysed. In total, 405 (25{$\cdot$}2 per cent) and 236 (45{$\cdot$}9 per cent) patients had a composite cardiovascular endpoint within 3 years after CEA and IFE respectively. Corrected for possible confounders, the percentage of patients with a secondary cardiovascular event after CEA did not change over time (hazard ratio (HR) 0{$\cdot$}91, 95 per cent c.i. 0{$\cdot$}65 to 1{$\cdot$}28; P = 0{$\cdot$}590, for 2011--2012 versus 2003--2004). In patients who had IFE, the incidence of secondary cardiovascular events significantly decreased only in the last 2 years (HR 0{$\cdot$}62, 0{$\cdot$}41 to 0{$\cdot$}94; P = 0{$\cdot$}024), owing to a decrease in peripheral (re)interventions in 2011--2012 (HR 0{$\cdot$}59, 0{$\cdot$}37 to 0{$\cdot$}94; P = 0{$\cdot$}028). No decrease in major cardiovascular events was observed in either group.                                         Conclusion               In patients who had undergone either CEA or IFE there was no evidence of a decrease in all secondary cardiovascular events. There were no differences in major cardiovascular events.},

  abstract = {Aims Identification and management of the Standard Modifiable Cardiovascular Risk Factors (SMuRFs; hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, diabetes and smoking) has substantially improved cardiovascular disease outcomes. However, cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide. Suspecting an evolving pattern of risk factor profiles in the ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) population with the improvements in primary care, we hypothesized that the proportion of 'SMuRFless' STEMI patients may have increased. Methods/results We performed a single centre retrospective study of consecutive STEMI patients presenting from January 2006 to December 2014. Over the study period 132/695 (25\%) STEMI patients had 0 SMuRFs, a proportion that did not significantly change with age, gender or family history. The proportion of STEMI patients who were SMuRFless in 2006 was 11\%, which increased to 27\% by 2014 (odds ratio 1.12 per year, 95\% confidence interval: 1.04-1.22). The proportion of patients with hypercholesterolaemia decreased (odds ratio 0.92, 95\% confidence interval 0.86-0.98), as did the proportion of current smokers (odds ratio 0.93, 95\% confidence interval 0.86-0.99), with no significant change in the proportion of patients with diabetes and hypertension. SMuRF status was not associated with extent of coronary disease; in-hospital outcomes, or discharge prescribing patterns. Conclusion The proportion of STEMI patients with STEMI poorly explained by SMuRFs is high, and is significantly increasing. This highlights the need for bold approaches to discover new mechanisms and markers for early identification of these patients, as well as to understand the outcomes and develop new targeted therapies.},

These have been used in conjunction with primary and secondary prevention strategies targeting SMuRFs to reduce the burden of CAD. Recent studies show that up to 25\% of ACS patients do not have any SMuRFs. Thus, SMuRFs do not explain the entire burden of CAD. There appears to be variation at the individual level rendering some individuals relatively susceptible or resilient to developing atherosclerosis. Important disease pathways remain to be discovered, and there is renewed enthusiasm to discover novel biomarkers, biological mechanisms, and therapeutic targets for atherosclerosis. Two broad approaches are being taken: traditional approaches investigating known candidate pathways and unbiased omics approaches. We review recent progress in the field and discuss opportunities made possible by technological and data science advances. Developments in network analytics and machine learning algorithms used in conjunction with large-scale multi-omic platforms have the potential to uncover biological networks that may not have been identifiable using traditional approaches. These approaches are useful for both biomedical research and precision medicine strategies.},

  abstract = {Introduction               Prediction models for clinical outcome after carotid artery stenting or carotid endarterectomy could aid physicians in estimating peri- and postprocedural risks in individual patients. We aimed to identify existing prediction models for short- and long-term outcome after carotid artery stenting or carotid endarterectomy in patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic carotid stenosis, and to summarise their most important predictors and predictive performance.                                         Patients and methods               We performed a systematic literature search for studies that developed a prediction model or risk score published until 22 December 2016. Eligible prediction models had to predict the risk of vascular events with at least one patient characteristic.                                         Results               We identified 37 studies that developed 46 prediction models. Thirty-four (74\%) models were developed in carotid endarterectomy patients; 27 of these (59\%) predicted short-term (in-hospital or within 30 days) risk. Most commonly predicted outcome was stroke or death (n\,=\,12; 26\%). Age (n\,=\,31; 67\%), diabetes mellitus (n\,=\,21; 46\%), heart failure (n\,=\,16; 35\%), and contralateral carotid stenosis {$\geq$}50\% or occlusion (n\,=\,16; 35\%) were most commonly used as predictors. For 25 models (54\%), it was unclear how missing data were handled; a complete case analysis was performed in 15 (33\%) of the remaining 21 models. Twenty-eight (61\%) models reported the full regression formula or risk score with risk classification. Twenty-one (46\%) models were validated internally and 12 (26\%) externally. Discriminative performance (c-statistic) ranged from 0.66 to 0.94 for models after carotid artery stenting and from 0.58 to 0.74 for models after carotid endarterectomy. The c-statistic ranged from 0.55 to 0.72 for the external validations.                                         Discussion               Age, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, and contralateral carotid stenosis {$\geq$}50\% or occlusion were most often used as predictors in all models. Discriminative performance (c-statistic) was higher for prediction models after carotid artery stenting than after carotid endarterectomy.                                         Conclusion               The clinical usefulness of most prediction models for short- or long-term outcome after carotid artery stenting or carotid endarterectomy remains unclear because of incomplete reporting, methodological limitations, and lack of external validation.},

The reporting of such research is often inadequate, which hampers the assessment of its strengths and weaknesses and of a study's generalizability. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Initiative developed recommendations on what should be included in an accurate and complete report of an observational study. We defined the scope of the recommendations to cover three main study designs: cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies. We convened a 2-day workshop in September 2004, with methodologists, researchers, and journal editors to draft a checklist of items. This list was subsequently revised during several meetings of the coordinating group and in e-mail discussions with the larger group of STROBE contributors, taking into account empirical evidence and methodological considerations. The workshop and the subsequent iterative process of consultation and revision resulted in a checklist of 22 items (the STROBE Statement) that relate to the title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections of articles. Eighteen items are common to all three study designs and four are specific for cohort, case-control, or cross-sectional studies. A detailed Explanation and Elaboration document is published separately and is freely available on the web sites of PLoS Medicine, Annals of Internal Medicine, and Epidemiology. We hope that the STROBE Statement will contribute to improving the quality of reporting of observational studies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coronary vascular dysfunction has been linked to atherosclerosis and adverse cardiovascular outcomes in men, but these relationships have not been firmly established in women. METHODS AND RESULTS: As part of the Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation (WISE) sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, 163 women referred for clinically indicated coronary angiography underwent coronary reactivity assessment with quantitative coronary angiography and intracoronary Doppler flow before and after intracoronary administration of acetylcholine, adenosine, and nitroglycerin and were then followed up for clinical outcomes. History of hypertension was present in 61\%, dyslipidemia in 54\%, diabetes in 26\%, and current tobacco use in 21\% of women enrolled. Seventy-five percent had no or only mild epicardial coronary artery disease (CAD). Over a median follow-up of 48 months, events occurred in 58 women. On bivariate analysis, women with an event had significantly less change in coronary cross-sectional area (DeltaCSA) in response to acetylcholine (P=0.0006) and nitroglycerin (P=0.04). In addition, women with abnormal coronary dilator response to acetylcholine had less time free from cardiovascular events (P=0.004). In multivariable analysis, after controlling for age, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, tobacco use, and CAD severity, \%DeltaCSA with acetylcholine (P=0.001) independently predicted events. When the outcome was restricted to only death, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and stroke, \%DeltaCSA with acetylcholine remained a significant predictor (P=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: In women in this study, impaired coronary vasomotor response to acetylcholine was independently linked to adverse cardiovascular outcomes regardless of CAD severity.},

It involves a critical understanding of players usually not specialized in acute stroke treatments. There is contradictory information about gender inequity in prehospital stroke detection, dispatch, and delivery to hospital stroke centers. The aim of this narrative review is to summarize the knowledge of gender differences in the first three stages of acute stroke management. Information on the detection of acute stroke symptoms by patients, their relatives, and bystanders is discussed. Women seem to have a better overall knowledge about stroke, although general understanding needs to be improved. However, older age and different social situations of women could be identified as reasons for reduced and delayed help-seeking. Dispatch and delivery lie within the responsibility of the emergency medical service. Differences in clinical presentation with symptoms mainly affecting general conditions could be identified as a crucial challenge leading to gender inequity in these stages. Improvement of stroke education has to be applied to tackle this inequal management. However, specifically designed projects and analyses are needed to understand more details of sex differences in prehospital stroke management, which is a necessary first step for the potential development of substantially improving strategies.},

  abstract = {Inflammation is known as an important mechanism of cognitive dysfunction. Systemic immune inflammation index (SII) and system inflammation response index (SIRI) are two blood inflammatory markers, which are related to many chronic diseases including cognitive impairment. It is recognized that dietary inflammatory index (DII), which is used to estimate the overall inflammatory potential of diet, may be related to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as well. This study aimed to explore the relationship between SII, SIRI and DII, as well as the role of these inflammatory indexes on MCI in elderly people. A total of 1050 participants from Beijing were included. Neuropsychological tests were used for cognitive evaluation. Energy-adjusted DII scores were calculated based on semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Blood samples were tested for calculating SII and SIRI. Log-binomial regression models were used to estimate the correlation of indexes. After adjusting demographic characteristics, SII and SIRI in MCI individuals were higher than controls (p {$\leq$} 0.001). DII, SII and SIRI had positive relationship with MoCA scores (p {$<$} 0.005). DII also correlated with SIRI in MCI ({$\beta$} = 0.11, p = 0.031). Higher DII and SIRI could definitely increase the risk of MCI, as well as DII and SII (p {$<$} 0.005). In conclusion, DII was positively correlated with blood inflammation. The elderly with higher level of DII and SIRI, or DII and SII could be considered as people with higher risk of developing MCI.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose---               To date, there is still uncertainty about age and sex differences in access to stroke unit treatment and use of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT), while age and sex differences have not been investigated for the new treatment option of mechanical thrombectomy (MT). We, therefore, undertook a complete nationwide analysis of all hospitalized ischemic stroke patients in Germany from 2013 to 2017.                                         Methods---               We used the nationwide administrative database of the German Federal Statistical Office and investigated access to stroke unit treatment, IVT, MT, and in-hospital mortality. Patients were subdivided into 6 predefined age groups (20--44, 45--59, 60--69, 70--79, 80--89, and {$>$}90 years). Pooled overall and age group estimates were calculated using the random-effects model. To evaluate potential sex disparities, we estimated odds ratios (ORs) with 95\% CIs.                                         Results---                                A total of 1\,112\,570 patients were hospitalized for first or recurrent ischemic stroke from 2013 to 2017. Overall, stroke unit treatment increased significantly from 66.8\% in 2013 to 73.5\% in 2017, as did IVT (from 12.4\% to 15.9\%) and MT (from 2.4\% to 5.8\%; all                 P                 {$<$}0.001). Although the difference became smaller over time, patients {$\geq$}80 years of age still received significantly less often treatments. Men of all age groups had a significantly higher probability receiving stroke unit treatment (OR, 1.11; 95\% CI, 1.09--1.12) and lower in-hospital mortality (OR, 0.91; 95\% CI, 0.89--0.93). No disparity was observed in the use of IVT (OR, 1.00; 95\% CI, 0.98--1.01), while women of all ages were treated more often with MT (OR, 1.26; 95\% CI, 1.22--1.30).                                                        Conclusions---               Access to stroke unit treatment has to be increased in both older patients and women of all ages. While there was no sex difference in IVT use, it is important to further investigate the significantly higher frequency of MT in women with ischemic stroke irrespective of age.},

Methods               We investigated sex-related differences in clinical presentation, stroke etiology and short-term outcomes in consecutive young patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) below the age of 50~years receiving mechanical thrombectomy (MT) between January 2011 and May 2021 in a tertiary stroke center.                                         Results               We identified a total of 202 young ischemic stroke patients with MT, with 51\% being female. Young female AIS patients were significantly younger (39\,{\textpm}\,8 vs. 43\,{\textpm}\,7~years, p\,{$<$}\,0.001), and presented with a trend for more severe stroke on admission (median NIHSS 12 vs. 9, p\,=\,0.065), compared to males, respectively. Young female AIS patients had higher rates of embolic strokes of determined or undetermined sources in the anterior circulation, while young male AIS patients suffered more often strokes of arterio-arterial embolism. Complete reperfusion (TICI score 3) was achieved significantly less often in young female AIS patients (69\% vs. 83\%, p\,=\,0.006), and in-hospital mortality was 2-times higher (5\% vs. 2\%, p\,=\,0.271) compared to males.

The subjects consisted of 17,670 males attending for routine health screening, with an average age of 43 years and a range of 16-91 years. The number of cigarettes smoked each day was divided into six categories, and declared alcohol consumption into seven. Of the 42 different combinations of smoking and drinking groups, five were not reported because they contained less than 30 subjects. Haemoglobin concentration was significantly increased in those smoking more than 10 cigarettes per day. Smoking also increased the PCV. Alcohol had no effect on Hb or PCV. The red cell count was reduced by alcohol consumption, with even the lowest consumption producing a significant decrease. Both smoking and drinking raised the MCV in a linear dose relationship. The marked increase in white cell count with smoking was seen even in subjects smoking 10 cigarettes per day or less. It is suggested that social habits such as smoking and drinking should be considered when interpreting blood haematology values. Changes in haematology results could be used to encourage a healthier lifestyle.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Growth-differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) is a member of the transforming growth factor-beta cytokine superfamily that is induced in the heart after ischemia-and-reperfusion injury. Circulating levels of GDF-15 may provide prognostic information in patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome. METHODS AND RESULTS: Blood samples were obtained on admission from 2081 patients with acute chest pain and either ST-segment depression or troponin elevation who were included in the Global Utilization of Strategies to Open Occluded Arteries (GUSTO)-IV Non-ST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome trial and from a matching cohort of 429 apparently healthy individuals. GDF-15 levels were determined by immunoradiometric assay. Approximately two thirds of patients presented with GDF-15 levels above the upper limit of normal in healthy controls (1200 ng/L); one third presented with levels {$>$}1800 ng/L. Increasing tertiles of GDF-15 were associated with an enhanced risk of death at 1 year (1.5\%, 5.0\%, and 14.1\%; P{$<$}0.001). By multiple Cox regression analysis, only the levels of GDF-15 and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, together with age and a history of previous myocardial infarction, contributed independently to 1-year mortality risk. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses further illustrated that GDF-15 is a strong marker of 1-year mortality risk (area under the curve, 0.757; best cutoff, 1808 ng/L). At this cutoff value, GDF-15 added significant prognostic information in patient subgroups defined by age; gender; time from symptom onset to admission; cardiovascular risk factors; previous cardiovascular disease; and the risk markers ST-segment depression, troponin T, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, C-reactive protein, and creatinine clearance. CONCLUSIONS: GDF-15 is a new biomarker of the risk for death in patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome that provides prognostic information beyond that provided by established clinical and biochemical markers.},

  abstract = {ObjectiveTo determine the long-term association of hemoglobin levels and anemia with risk of dementia, and explore underlying substrates on brain MRI in the general population.MethodsSerum hemoglobin was measured in 12,305 participants without dementia of the population-based Rotterdam Study (mean age 64.6 years, 57.7\% women). We determined risk of dementia and Alzheimer disease (AD) (until 2016) in relation to hemoglobin and anemia. Among 5,267 participants without dementia with brain MRI, we assessed hemoglobin in relation to vascular brain disease, structural connectivity, and global cerebral perfusion.ResultsDuring a mean follow-up of 12.1 years, 1,520 individuals developed dementia, 1,194 of whom had AD. We observed a U-shaped association between hemoglobin levels and dementia (p = 0.005), such that both low and high hemoglobin levels were associated with increased dementia risk (hazard ratio [95\% confidence interval (CI)], lowest vs middle quintile 1.29 [1.09--1.52]; highest vs middle quintile 1.20 [1.00--1.44]). Overall prevalence of anemia was 6.1\%, and anemia was associated with a 34\% increased risk of dementia (95\% CI 11\%--62\%) and 41\% (15\%--74\%) for AD. Among individuals without dementia with brain MRI, similar U-shaped associations were seen of hemoglobin with white matter hyperintensity volume (p = 0.03), and structural connectivity (for mean diffusivity, p {$<$} 0.0001), but not with presence of cortical and lacunar infarcts. Cerebral microbleeds were more common with anemia. Hemoglobin levels inversely correlated to cerebral perfusion (p {$<$} 0.0001).ConclusionLow and high levels of hemoglobin are associated with an increased risk of dementia, including AD, which may relate to differences in white matter integrity and cerebral perfusion.},

We enrolled 201 patients in the retrospective study with complete clinical and laboratory data. The SII was calculated as platelet count {\texttimes} neutrophil count/lymphocyte count. Cognitive function was evaluated by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Total CSVD burden was assessed based on magnetic resonance imaging. We performed logistic regression models, Spearman correlation, and mediation analysis to evaluate the associations of SII with CSVD burden and cognitive impairment. After adjustment for confounding factors in the multivariate binary logistic regression model, elevated SII (odds ratio [OR], 3.263; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.577--6.752; P = 0.001) or severe CSVD burden (OR, 2.794; 95\% CI, 1.342--5.817; P = 0.006) was significantly associated with the risk of cognitive impairment. Correlation analyses revealed that SII levels were negatively associated with MMSE scores (rs = -0.391, P {$<$} 0.001), and positively associated with the total CSVD burden score (rs = 0.361, P {$<$} 0.001). Moreover, SII was significantly related to the severity of the CSVD burden (OR, 2.674; 95\% CI, 1.359--5.263; P = 0.004). The multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (95\% CI) in highest tertile versus lowest tertile of SII were 8.947 (3.315--24.145) for cognitive impairment and 4.945 (2.063--11.854) for severe CSVD burden, respectively. The effect of higher SII on cognitive impairment development was partly mediated by severe CSVD burden. Elevated SII is associated with severe CSVD burden and cognitive impairment. The mediating role of severe CSVD burden suggests that higher SII may contribute to cognitive impairment through aggravating CSVD burden.},

We aimed to define gene expression profiles in blood that differentiate cardioembolic from large-vessel atherosclerotic stroke. Peripheral blood samples were obtained from healthy controls and acute ischemic stroke patients ({$<$} 3, 5, and 24 h). RNA was purified, labeled, and applied to Affymetrix Human U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays. Expression profiles in the blood of cardioembolic stroke patients are distinctive from those of large-vessel atherosclerotic stroke patients. Seventy-seven genes differ at least 1.5-fold between them, and a minimum number of 23 genes differentiate the two types of stroke with at least 95.2\% specificity and 95.2\% sensitivity for each. Genes regulated in large-vessel atherosclerotic stroke are expressed in platelets and monocytes and modulate hemostasis. Genes regulated in cardioembolic stroke are expressed in neutrophils and modulate immune responses to infectious stimuli. This new method can be used to predict whether a stroke of unknown etiology was because of cardioembolism or large-vessel atherosclerosis that would lead to different therapy. These results have wide ranging implications for similar disorders.},

  abstract = {Increased red blood cell distribution width (RDW), a marker of anisocytosis, has been associated with adverse outcomes in multiple settings. Whether RDW is predictive of mortality in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) is unknown. We studied 13,039 consecutive outpatients (69.5 {\textpm} 12.0 years of age, 60.9\% men, 97.6\% white) with PAD identified by noninvasive lower-extremity arterial testing at the Mayo Clinic from January 1997 through December 2007, with follow-up through September 2009. We defined PAD as a low ({$\leq$} 0.9) or high ({$\geq$} 1.4) ankle-brachial index (ABI). Cardiovascular risk factors and co-morbidities were ascertained using electronic medical record-based algorithms. RDW was obtained from the complete blood cell count drawn around the time of arterial evaluation. Mortality was ascertained using the Mayo electronic medical record and Accurint databases. Association of RDW with all-cause mortality was analyzed by multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. During a median follow-up of 5.5 years, 4,039 (31.0\%) deaths occurred (28.7\% in low and 38.9\% in high ABI subsets). After adjustment for age, gender, cardiovascular risk factors, and co-morbidities, patients in the highest quartile of RDW ({$>$} 14.5\%) had a 66\% greater risk of mortality compared to the lowest quartile ({$<$} 12.8\%, p {$<$} 0.0001); a 1\% increment in RDW was associated with a 10\% greater risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 1.10, 95\% confidence interval 1.08 to 1.12, p {$<$} 0.0001). The adjusted hazard ratio was similar in the low (1.10, 1.08 to 1.12) and high (1.09, 1.06 to 1.12) ABI subsets. In conclusion, RDW, a routinely available measurement, is an independent prognostic marker in patients with PAD.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recently we published a novel method of thrombus preparation for use in a swine model for evaluation of thrombectomy designs. The clot (fibrin rich clot) is characterized by its similarity in histologic characteristics to the thromboemboli recovered from stroke patients. The purpose of this latest study was to evaluate if the performance of a mechanical thrombectomy device was affected by the histologic characteristics of thromboembolus. Erythrocyte rich clot, which was created using exogenous thrombin, and the novel experimental clot with abundance of fibrin/cellular component were used for comparison. The Merci clot retriever was used for the evaluation and the angiographic outcomes were analyzed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two histologically different types of experimental clot, a conventionally used thrombin-induced clot (erythrocyte-rich clot) and a novel experimental clot that is similar in histologic characteristics to the thromboemboli recovered from patients with stroke (fibrin-rich clot), were prepared. Eight extracranial arteries in swine were occluded with erythrocyte-rich clot (group A), and 8 were occluded with fibrin-rich clot (group B), and MT by using the Merci clot retriever device was performed. Angiographic results in each group were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 48 attempts at MT were made. The average number of attempts to achieve TIMI grade II or III recanalization was 2.75 times in group A and 4.5 times in group B (P {$<$} .001), respectively. The mean time to achieve recanalization was 15.5 minutes in group A and 81.5 minutes in group B (P {$<$} .01). Every vessel in group A showed recanalization (100\%), whereas only 3 of 8 samples (37.5\%) achieved recanalization in group B. CONCLUSIONS: In this model, arteries occluded by fibrin-rich clot demonstrated a significantly lower recanalization rate, lower final TIMI score, and a longer mean recanalization time than did arteries occluded by erythrocyte-rich clot. The angiographic outcome of MT by using the Merci clot retriever system was influenced by the histologic characteristics of the occluding thromboembolus.},

The North American Solitaire Stent Retriever Acute Stroke (NASA) registry aimed to assess the real world performance of the Solitaire FR device in contrast with the results from the SWIFT (Solitaire with the Intention for Thrombectomy) and TREVO 2 (Trevo versus Merci retrievers for thrombectomy revascularization of large vessel occlusions in acute ischemic stroke) trials. METHODS: The investigator initiated NASA registry recruited North American sites to submit retrospective angiographic and clinical outcome data on consecutive acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients treated with the Solitaire FR between March 2012 and February 2013. The primary outcome was a Thrombolysis in Myocardial Ischemia (TIMI) score of {$\geq$}2 or a Treatment in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) score of {$\geq$}2a. Secondary outcomes were 90 day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score, mortality, and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. RESULTS: 354 patients underwent treatment for AIS using the Solitaire FR device in 24 centers. Mean time from onset to groin puncture was 363.4{\textpm}239\>min, mean fluoroscopy time was 32.9{\textpm}25.7\>min, and mean procedure time was 100.9{\textpm}57.8\>min. Recanalization outcome: TIMI {$\geq$}2 rate of 83.3\% (315/354) and TICI {$\geq$}2a rate of 87.5\% (310/354) compared with the operator reported TIMI {$\geq$}2 rate of 83\% in SWIFT and TICI {$\geq$}2a rate of 85\% in TREVO 2. CLINICAL OUTCOME: 42\% (132/315) of NASA patients demonstrated a 90 day mRS {$\leq$}2 compared with 37\% (SWIFT) and 40\% (TREVO 2). 90 day mortality was 30.2\% (95/315) versus 17.2\% (SWIFT) and 29\% (TREVO 2). CONCLUSIONS: The NASA registry demonstrated that the Solitaire FR device performance in clinical practice is comparable with the SWIFT and TREVO 2 trial results.},

  abstract = {Objective               Poststroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) is a serious complication of stroke. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a marker of peripheral inflammation. The relationship between the NLR and PSCI is far from well studied, and the thesis of this study was to assess the predictive value of the NLR in patients with PSCI, and establish and verify the corresponding prediction model based on this relationship.                                         Methods               A total of 367 stroke patients were included in this study. Neutrophils, lymphocytes, and NLRs were measured at baseline, and clinical and neuropsychological assessments were conducted 3 months after stroke. The National Institutes of Health Scale (NIHSS) was used to assess the severity of stroke. A Chinese version of the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used for the assessment of cognitive function.                                         Results                                After three months of follow-up, 87 (23.7\%) patients were diagnosed with PSCI. The NLR was significantly higher in PSCI patients than in non-PSCI patients (                 P                 \&lt; 0.001). Patient age, sex, body mass index, NIHSS scores, and high-density lipoprotein levels also differed in the univariate analysis. In the logistic regression analysis, the NLR was an independent risk factor associated with the patients with PSCI after adjustment for potential confounders (OR = 1.67, 95\%CI: 1.21--2.29,                 P                 = 0.002). The nomogram based on patient sex, age, NIHSS score, and NLR had good predictive power with an AUC of 0.807. In the validation group, the AUC was 0.816.                                                        Conclusion               An increased NLR at admission is associated with PSCI, and the model built with NLR as one of the predictors can increase prognostic information for the early detection of PSCI.},

The optimal design of future randomized control trials (RCTs) of anti-inflammatory therapies to prevent recurrence after stroke must be informed by a clear understanding of the prognostic role of inflammation according to stroke subtype and individual patient factors.Aim:In this narrative review, we discuss (1) inflammatory pathways in the etiology of ischemic stroke subtypes; (2) the evidence on inflammatory markers and vascular recurrence after stroke; and (3) review RCT evidence of anti-inflammatory agents for vascular prevention.Summary of review:Experimental work, genetic epidemiological data, and plaque-imaging studies all implicate inflammation in atherosclerotic stroke. However, emerging evidence also suggests that inflammatory mechanisms are also important in other stroke mechanisms. Advanced neuroimaging techniques support the role of neuroinflammation in blood--brain barrier dysfunction in cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD). Systemic inflammatory processes also promote atrial cardiopathy, incident and recurrent atrial fibrillation (AF). Although several inflammatory markers have been associated with recurrence after stroke, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) are presently the most promising markers to identify patients at increased vascular risk. Several RCTs have shown that anti-inflammatory therapies reduce vascular risk, including stroke, in coronary artery disease (CAD). Some, but not all of these trials, selected patients on the basis of elevated hsCRP. Although unproven after stroke, targeting inflammation to reduce recurrence is a compelling strategy and several RCTs are ongoing.Conclusion:Evidence points toward the importance of inflammation across multiple stroke etiologies and potential benefit of anti-inflammatory targets in secondary stroke prevention. Taking the heterogeneous stroke etiologies into account, the use of serum biomarkers could be useful to identify patients with residual inflammatory risk and perform biomarker-led patient selection for future RCTs.},
