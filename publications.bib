  abstract = {Biological processes underlying cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) are largely unknown. We hypothesized that identification of clusters of inter-related bood-based biomarkers that are associated with the burden of cSVD provides leads on underlying biological processes. In 494 participants (mean age 67.6\,{\textpm}\,8.7\,years; 36\% female; 75\% cardiovascular diseases; 25\% reference participants) we assessed the relation between 92 blood-based biomarkers from the OLINK cardiovascular III panel and cSVD, using cluster-based analyses. We focused particularly on white matter hyperintensities (WMH). Nineteen biomarkers individually correlated with WMH ratio (r range: 0.16--0.27, Bonferroni corrected p-values {$<$}0.05), of which sixteen biomarkers formed one biomarker cluster. Pathway analysis showed that this biomarker cluster predominantly reflected coagulation processes. This cluster related also significantly to other cSVD manifestations (lacunar infarcts, microbleeds, and enlarged perivascular spaces), which supports generalizability beyond WMHs. To study possible causal effects of biological processes reflected by the cluster we performed a mediation analysis that showed a mediation effect of the cluster on the relation between age and WMH ratio (proportion mediated 17\%), and hypertension and WMH-volume (proportion mediated 21\%). In conclusion, we identified a cluster of blood-based biomarkers reflecting coagulation, that is related to manifestations of cSVD, corroborating involvement of coagulation abnormalities in the etiology of cSVD.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               The new concept of difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis (D2T RA) refers to RA patients who remain symptomatic after several lines of treatment, resulting in a high patient and economic burden. During a hackathon, we aimed to identify and predict D2T RA patients in structured and unstructured routine care data.                                         Methods               Routine care data of 1873 RA patients were extracted from the Utrecht Patient Oriented Database. Data from a previous cross-sectional study, in which 152 RA patients were clinically classified as either D2T or non-D2T, served as a validation set. Machine learning techniques, text mining, and feature importance analyses were performed to identify and predict D2T RA patients based on structured and unstructured routine care data.                                         Results               We identified 123 potentially new D2T RA patients by applying the D2T RA definition in structured and unstructured routine care data. Additionally, we developed a D2T RA identification model derived from a feature importance analysis of all available structured data (AUC-ROC 0.88 (95\% CI 0.82--0.94)), and we demonstrated the potential of longitudinal hematological data to differentiate D2T from non-D2T RA patients using supervised dimension reduction. Lastly, using data up to the time of starting the first biological treatment, we predicted future development of D2TRA (AUC-ROC 0.73 (95\% CI 0.71--0.75)).                                         Conclusions               During this hackathon, we have demonstrated the potential of different techniques for the identification and prediction of D2T RA patients in structured as well as unstructured routine care data. The results are promising and should be optimized and validated in future research.},

We hypothesized that identification of protein clusters associated with lower CBF in patients with CVD may explain underlying processes. In 428 participants (74\% cardiovascular diseases; 26\% reference participants) from the Heart-Brain Connection Study, we assessed the relationship between 92 plasma proteins from the Olink{\textregistered} cardiovascular III panel and normal-appearing grey matter CBF, using affinity propagation and hierarchical clustering algorithms, and generated a Biomarker Compound Score (BCS). The BCS was related to cardiovascular risk and observed cardiovascular events within 2-year follow-up using Spearman correlation and logistic regression. Thirteen proteins were associated with CBF ({$\rho$}               Spearman               range: -0.10 to -0.19, p               FDR-corrected               {$<$}0.05), and formed one cluster. The cluster primarily reflected extracellular matrix organization processes. The BCS was higher in patients with CVD compared to reference participants (p               FDR-corrected               {$<$}0.05) and was associated with cardiovascular risk ({$\rho$}               Spearman               0.42, p\,{$<$}\,0.001) and cardiovascular events (OR 2.05, p\,{$<$}\,0.01).

  abstract = {Background               Exclusion of coronary stenosis in individuals with suggestive symptoms is challenging. Cardiac CT or coronary angiography is often used but is inefficient and costly and involves risks. Sex-stratified algorithms based on electronic health records (EHRs) could be a non-invasive alternative for excluding coronary stenosis, yet their performance may vary by healthcare settings. Thus, external validation is crucial for determining their generalisability. This study aimed to externally validate sex-stratified machine learning algorithms based on EHR data to predict the absence of coronary stenosis, evaluated in diverse clinical settings.                                         Methods               Sex-stratified XGBoost algorithms were trained on EHR data from patients who underwent coronary imaging at the University Medical Center Utrecht (n=14 674) and externally tested on EHR data of 13 Cardiology centres in the Netherlands (n=9252). The outcome was defined as the absence of coronary stenosis, identified through text mining of radiology report conclusions, and predictive performance was assessed by negative predictive values (NPVs) and specificities.                                         Results               On the training cohort (9298 men (median age 55 years, 73\% no coronary stenosis) and 5376 women (median age 59 years, 83\% no coronary stenosis)), the algorithms showed NPVs and specificities of 0.95 and 0.14 in men and 0.93 and 0.26 in women, respectively. On the testing cohort (4762 men (median age 60 years, 60\% no coronary stenosis) and 4490 women (median age 60 years, 83\% no coronary stenosis)), the algorithm showed NPVs and specificities of 0.89 and 0.07 in men and 0.87 and 0.18 in women, respectively.                                         Conclusions               This study externally validates sex-stratified machine learning algorithms using EHR data to non-invasively predict the absence of coronary stenosis, with high NPVs observed across settings. However, given the modest specificity and study limitations, these findings should be considered preliminary, warranting further refinement before clinical adoption.},

This will likely result in an increased imaging use. Symptom recognition can be complicated, as symptoms caused by CAD can be atypical, particularly in women. Early CAD exclusion may help to optimize use of diagnostic resources and thus improve the sustainability of the healthcare system. To develop sex-stratified algorithms, trained on routinely available electronic health records (EHRs), raw electrocardiograms, and haematology data to exclude CAD in patients upfront.                                         Methods and results               We trained XGBoost algorithms on data from patients from the Utrecht Patient-Oriented Database, who underwent coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), and/or stress cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, or stress single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) in the UMC Utrecht. Outcomes were extracted from radiology reports. We aimed to maximize negative predictive value (NPV) to minimize the false negative risk with acceptable specificity. Of 6808 CCTA patients (31\% female), 1029 females (48\%) and 1908 males (45\%) had no diagnosis of CAD. Of 3053 CMR/SPECT patients (45\% female), 650 females (47\%) and 881 males (48\%) had no diagnosis of CAD. On the train and test set, the CCTA models achieved NPVs and specificities of 0.95 and 0.19 (females) and 0.96 and 0.09 (males). The CMR/SPECT models achieved NPVs and specificities of 0.75 and 0.041 (females) and 0.92 and 0.026 (males).

In women, successful recanalization and cardioembolism were associated with a higher number of reticulocytes, while unsuccessful recanalization and large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) as cause of stroke~were associated with a higher mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration. In men, unsuccessful recanalization and LAA as cause of~stroke were associated with a higher coefficient of variance of lymphocyte complexity of the intracellular structure.

Because routinely obtained laboratory data are abundantly present, often numeric, generated by certified laboratories, and stored in a structured way, one may assume that they are immediately fit for (re)use in research. However, behind each test result lies an extensive context of choices and considerations, made by both humans and machines, that introduces hidden patterns in the data. If they are unaware, researchers reusing routine laboratory data may eventually draw incorrect conclusions. In this paper, after discussing health care system characteristics on both the macro and micro level, we introduce the reader to hidden aspects of generating structured routine laboratory data in 4 steps (ordering, preanalysis, analysis, and postanalysis) and explain how each of these steps may interfere with the reuse of routine laboratory data. As researchers reusing these data, we underline the importance of domain knowledge of the health care professional, laboratory specialist, data manager, and patient to turn routine laboratory data into meaningful data sets to help obtain relevant insights that create value for clinical care.},
