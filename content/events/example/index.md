summary: 'Individualized Risk Prediction for Cognitive Decline and Cardiovasular Events in VCI: A Bayesian Network'

abstract: 'Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is a heterogeneous construct marked by large variability in cardiovascular risk factors, clinical symptoms, and long-term outcomes. Individuals with VCI are at risk of cognitive decline, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), or both. Predicting these outcomes is challenging due to complex interdependencies among variables, attrition bias in longitudinal studies, and uncertainty about the added predictive value of specialized biomarkers. We propose a Bayesian network (BN) approach to address these challenges using three illustrative examples.
