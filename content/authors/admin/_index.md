Dr. Malin Overmars (MSc Data Science) is a postdoctoral researcher and data scientist at UMC Utrecht, within the Vascular Cognitive Impairment research group (Prof. Geert Jan Biessels; Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery). Her research focuses on precision diagnostics and subtyping of vascular cognitive impairment through data-driven pattern recognition. She develops interpretable Bayesian networks to model the combined risk of cognitive decline and cardiovascular events, and integrates multimodal biomarkers (including MRI features and blood biomarkers) for more accurate and personalized diagnosis of vascular dementia. Within the TAP-Dementia consortium, she is developing a multimodal tool for mixed dementia pathology that brings together clinical, imaging, and blood markers in a single interpretable decision model with a view to translational applicability.
