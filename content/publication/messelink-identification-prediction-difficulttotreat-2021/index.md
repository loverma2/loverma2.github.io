abstract: Abstract                            Background               The new concept
  of difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis (D2T RA) refers to RA patients who remain
  symptomatic after several lines of treatment, resulting in a high patient and economic
  burden. During a hackathon, we aimed to identify and predict D2T RA patients in
  structured and unstructured routine care data.                                         Methods               Routine
  care data of 1873 RA patients were extracted from the Utrecht Patient Oriented Database.
  Data from a previous cross-sectional study, in which 152 RA patients were clinically
  classified as either D2T or non-D2T, served as a validation set. Machine learning
  techniques, text mining, and feature importance analyses were performed to identify
  and predict D2T RA patients based on structured and unstructured routine care data.                                         Results               We
  identified 123 potentially new D2T RA patients by applying the D2T RA definition
  in structured and unstructured routine care data. Additionally, we developed a D2T
  RA identification model derived from a feature importance analysis of all available
  structured data (AUC-ROC 0.88 (95% CI 0.82--0.94)), and we demonstrated the potential
  of longitudinal hematological data to differentiate D2T from non-D2T RA patients
  using supervised dimension reduction. Lastly, using data up to the time of starting
  the first biological treatment, we predicted future development of D2TRA (AUC-ROC
  0.73 (95% CI 0.71--0.75)).                                         Conclusions               During
  this hackathon, we have demonstrated the potential of different techniques for the
  identification and prediction of D2T RA patients in structured as well as unstructured
  routine care data. The results are promising and should be optimized and validated
  in future research.
