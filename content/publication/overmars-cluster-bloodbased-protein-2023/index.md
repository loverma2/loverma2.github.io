abstract: 'Biological processes underlying decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) in
  patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) are largely unknown. We hypothesized
  that identification of protein clusters associated with lower CBF in patients with
  CVD may explain underlying processes. In 428 participants (74% cardiovascular diseases;
  26% reference participants) from the Heart-Brain Connection Study, we assessed the
  relationship between 92 plasma proteins from the Olink® cardiovascular III panel
  and normal-appearing grey matter CBF, using affinity propagation and hierarchical
  clustering algorithms, and generated a Biomarker Compound Score (BCS). The BCS was
  related to cardiovascular risk and observed cardiovascular events within 2-year
  follow-up using Spearman correlation and logistic regression. Thirteen proteins
  were associated with CBF ($h̊o$               Spearman               range: -0.10
  to -0.19, p               FDR-corrected               $<$0.05), and formed one cluster.
  The cluster primarily reflected extracellular matrix organization processes. The
  BCS was higher in patients with CVD compared to reference participants (p               FDR-corrected               $<$0.05)
  and was associated with cardiovascular risk ($o̊$               Spearman               0.42,
  p,$<$,0.001) and cardiovascular events (OR 2.05, p,$<$,0.01). In conclusion, we
  identified a cluster of plasma proteins related to CBF, reflecting extracellular
  matrix organization processes, that is also related to future cardiovascular events
  in patients with CVD, representing potential targets to preserve CBF and mitigate
  cardiovascular risk in patients with CVD.'
