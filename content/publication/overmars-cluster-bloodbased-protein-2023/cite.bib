 abstract = {Biological processes underlying decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) are largely unknown. We hypothesized that identification of protein clusters associated with lower CBF in patients with CVD may explain underlying processes. In 428 participants (74% cardiovascular diseases; 26% reference participants) from the Heart-Brain Connection Study, we assessed the relationship between 92 plasma proteins from the Olink® cardiovascular III panel and normal-appearing grey matter CBF, using affinity propagation and hierarchical clustering algorithms, and generated a Biomarker Compound Score (BCS). The BCS was related to cardiovascular risk and observed cardiovascular events within 2-year follow-up using Spearman correlation and logistic regression. Thirteen proteins were associated with CBF ($h̊o$               Spearman               range: -0.10 to -0.19, p               FDR-corrected               $<$0.05), and formed one cluster. The cluster primarily reflected extracellular matrix organization processes. The BCS was higher in patients with CVD compared to reference participants (p               FDR-corrected               $<$0.05) and was associated with cardiovascular risk ($\o̊$               Spearman               0.42, p\,$<$\,0.001) and cardiovascular events (OR 2.05, p\,$<$\,0.01). In conclusion, we identified a cluster of plasma proteins related to CBF, reflecting extracellular matrix organization processes, that is also related to future cardiovascular events in patients with CVD, representing potential targets to preserve CBF and mitigate cardiovascular risk in patients with CVD.},
