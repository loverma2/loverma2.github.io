abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) contain valuable data for reuse in science,
  quality evaluations, and clinical decision support. Because routinely obtained laboratory
  data are abundantly present, often numeric, generated by certified laboratories,
  and stored in a structured way, one may assume that they are immediately fit for
  (re)use in research. However, behind each test result lies an extensive context
  of choices and considerations, made by both humans and machines, that introduces
  hidden patterns in the data. If they are unaware, researchers reusing routine laboratory
  data may eventually draw incorrect conclusions. In this paper, after discussing
  health care system characteristics on both the macro and micro level, we introduce
  the reader to hidden aspects of generating structured routine laboratory data in
  4 steps (ordering, preanalysis, analysis, and postanalysis) and explain how each
  of these steps may interfere with the reuse of routine laboratory data. As researchers
  reusing these data, we underline the importance of domain knowledge of the health
  care professional, laboratory specialist, data manager, and patient to turn routine
  laboratory data into meaningful data sets to help obtain relevant insights that
  create value for clinical care.
