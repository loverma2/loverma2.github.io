 abstract = {Abstract             Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) success to treat~acute ischemic stroke varies with factors like stroke etiology~and clot composition, which can differ between sexes. We studied if sex-specific blood cell characteristics (BCCs) are related to~recanalization success. We analyzed electronic health records of 333 EVT patients from a single intervention center, and extracted 71 BCCs from the Sapphire flow cytometry analyzer. Through~Sparse~Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis, incorporating cross-validation and stability selection, we~identified BCCs associated with successful recanalization (TICI 3) in~both sexes. Stroke etiology was considered, while controlling for cardiovascular risk factors. Of the patients, successful recanalization was achieved in 51% of women and 49% of men.~21 of the~71 BCCs~showed significant differences between sexes~ (pFDR-corrected\,$<$\,0.05). The female-focused recanalization model had~lower error rates than both combined [t(192.4)\,=\,5.9, p\,$<$\,0.001] and male-only models [t(182.6)\,=\,-~15.6, p\,$<$\,0.001]. In women, successful recanalization and cardioembolism were associated with a higher number of reticulocytes, while unsuccessful recanalization and large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) as cause of stroke~were associated with a higher mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration. In men, unsuccessful recanalization and LAA as cause of~stroke were associated with a higher coefficient of variance of lymphocyte complexity of the intracellular structure. Sex-specific BCCs related to recanalization success varied and were linked to stroke etiology. This enhanced understanding may facilitate personalized treatment for acute ischemic stroke.},
