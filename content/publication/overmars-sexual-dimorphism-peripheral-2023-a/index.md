abstract: Abstract             Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) success to treat~acute
  ischemic stroke varies with factors like stroke etiology~and clot composition, which
  can differ between sexes. We studied if sex-specific blood cell characteristics
  (BCCs) are related to~recanalization success. We analyzed electronic health records
  of 333 EVT patients from a single intervention center, and extracted 71 BCCs from
  the Sapphire flow cytometry analyzer. Through~Sparse~Partial Least Squares Discriminant
  Analysis, incorporating cross-validation and stability selection, we~identified
  BCCs associated with successful recanalization (TICI 3) in~both sexes. Stroke etiology
  was considered, while controlling for cardiovascular risk factors. Of the patients,
  successful recanalization was achieved in 51% of women and 49% of men.~21 of the~71
  BCCs~showed significant differences between sexes~ (pFDR-corrected,$<$,0.05). The
  female-focused recanalization model had~lower error rates than both combined [t(192.4),=,5.9,
  p,$<$,0.001] and male-only models [t(182.6),=,-~15.6, p,$<$,0.001]. In women, successful
  recanalization and cardioembolism were associated with a higher number of reticulocytes,
  while unsuccessful recanalization and large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) as cause
  of stroke~were associated with a higher mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration.
  In men, unsuccessful recanalization and LAA as cause of~stroke were associated with
  a higher coefficient of variance of lymphocyte complexity of the intracellular structure.
  Sex-specific BCCs related to recanalization success varied and were linked to stroke
  etiology. This enhanced understanding may facilitate personalized treatment for
  acute ischemic stroke.
