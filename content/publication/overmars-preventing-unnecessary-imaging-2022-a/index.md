abstract: Abstract                            Aims               With the ageing European
  population, the incidence of coronary artery disease (CAD) is expected to rise.
  This will likely result in an increased imaging use. Symptom recognition can be
  complicated, as symptoms caused by CAD can be atypical, particularly in women. Early
  CAD exclusion may help to optimize use of diagnostic resources and thus improve
  the sustainability of the healthcare system. To develop sex-stratified algorithms,
  trained on routinely available electronic health records (EHRs), raw electrocardiograms,
  and haematology data to exclude CAD in patients upfront.                                         Methods
  and results               We trained XGBoost algorithms on data from patients from
  the Utrecht Patient-Oriented Database, who underwent coronary computed tomography
  angiography (CCTA), and/or stress cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, or stress
  single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) in the UMC Utrecht. Outcomes
  were extracted from radiology reports. We aimed to maximize negative predictive
  value (NPV) to minimize the false negative risk with acceptable specificity. Of
  6808 CCTA patients (31% female), 1029 females (48%) and 1908 males (45%) had no
  diagnosis of CAD. Of 3053 CMR/SPECT patients (45% female), 650 females (47%) and
  881 males (48%) had no diagnosis of CAD. On the train and test set, the CCTA models
  achieved NPVs and specificities of 0.95 and 0.19 (females) and 0.96 and 0.09 (males).
  The CMR/SPECT models achieved NPVs and specificities of 0.75 and 0.041 (females)
  and 0.92 and 0.026 (males).                                         Conclusion               Coronary
  artery disease can be excluded from EHRs with high NPV. Our study demonstrates new
  possibilities to reduce unnecessary imaging in women and men suspected of CAD.
