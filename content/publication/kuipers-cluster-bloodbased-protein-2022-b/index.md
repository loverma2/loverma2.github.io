abstract: 'Biological processes underlying cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) are
  largely unknown. We hypothesized that identification of clusters of inter-related
  bood-based biomarkers that are associated with the burden of cSVD provides leads
  on underlying biological processes. In 494 participants (mean age 67.6,textpm,8.7,years;
  36% female; 75% cardiovascular diseases; 25% reference participants) we assessed
  the relation between 92 blood-based biomarkers from the OLINK cardiovascular III
  panel and cSVD, using cluster-based analyses. We focused particularly on white matter
  hyperintensities (WMH). Nineteen biomarkers individually correlated with WMH ratio
  (r range: 0.16--0.27, Bonferroni corrected p-values $<$0.05), of which sixteen biomarkers
  formed one biomarker cluster. Pathway analysis showed that this biomarker cluster
  predominantly reflected coagulation processes. This cluster related also significantly
  to other cSVD manifestations (lacunar infarcts, microbleeds, and enlarged perivascular
  spaces), which supports generalizability beyond WMHs. To study possible causal effects
  of biological processes reflected by the cluster we performed a mediation analysis
  that showed a mediation effect of the cluster on the relation between age and WMH
  ratio (proportion mediated 17%), and hypertension and WMH-volume (proportion mediated
  21%). In conclusion, we identified a cluster of blood-based biomarkers reflecting
  coagulation, that is related to manifestations of cSVD, corroborating involvement
  of coagulation abnormalities in the etiology of cSVD.'
